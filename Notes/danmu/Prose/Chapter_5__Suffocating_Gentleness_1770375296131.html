<p>第五章：窒息般的温柔</p>
<p>Before Chen Mo could set down his cup, warmth and softness surrounded him.</p>
<p>陈默甚至来不及放下酒杯，就被柔软而温热的触感包围。</p>
<p>It was completely different from the thin restraint he knew in the city.</p>
<p>那触感与城市里熟悉的克制与骨感完全不同。</p>
<p>When she moved close, he felt as if he had fallen into something soft yet full of heat.</p>
<p>她主动贴近时，他像陷进一团柔软却炽热的怀抱。</p>
<p>“Don’t speak,” she whispered, touching his lips before kissing him with the taste of plum wine.</p>
<p>“别说话……”她按住他的唇，随后带着梅酒气息吻了下来。</p>
<p>The kiss carried calm control and quiet guidance.</p>
<p>这个吻带着成熟的从容，也带着清晰的引导。</p>
<p>His restraint broke, and the pressure of the past years rushed out at once.</p>
<p>他的理智在这一刻断开，积压多年的疲惫一起涌出。</p>
<p>He held her clumsily, feeling warmth and fullness beneath his hands.</p>
<p>他笨拙地回抱，只感到掌心里的温度与柔软。</p>
<p>When they fell onto the tatami, her presence filled his sight and breath.</p>
<p>当两人倒在榻榻米上，她的存在几乎占满他的视线与呼吸。</p>
<p>She leaned over him, hair falling across his chest, her voice low beside his ear.</p>
<p>她俯身靠近，长发垂落在他胸前，声音贴在他耳边。</p>
<p>“Do you like it?” she asked softly. “You are the first to hold me like this.”</p>
<p>“喜欢吗？”她轻声问，“你是第一个这样抱我的人。”</p>
<p>In that moment she was no longer bound by daily life, only alive in the night and rain.</p>
<p>那一刻的她不再被日常束缚，只在雨夜中真实存在。</p>
<p>Chen Mo felt himself drifting without direction, yet he did not resist.</p>
<p>陈默像失去方向般下沉，却没有抗拒。</p></div>
