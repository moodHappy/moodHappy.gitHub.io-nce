<p>第四十五章：犹大的电话</p>
<p>Morning in the jungle. The mist was lifting, revealing the rotting concrete of the bunker.</p>
<p>丛林的清晨。雾气散去，露出了地堡腐烂的混凝土。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko sat on the hood of the Land Rover, holding the satellite phone. She cleared her throat, adjusting her pitch. She needed to sound desperate. Broken.</p>
<p>美悦子坐在路虎的引擎盖上，拿着卫星电话。她清了清嗓子，调整音调。她需要听起来绝望。破碎。</p>
<p>She dialed The Butcher's private number.</p>
<p>她拨通了屠夫的私人号码。</p>
<p>"Hola, puta (bitch)," The Butcher's voice answered immediately. He was expecting this call.</p>
<p>“你好啊，婊子，”屠夫的声音立刻响起。他在等这个电话。</p>
<p>"I surrender," Miyetsuko whispered, letting a fake sob catch in her throat. "We are... hurt. Chen is dying. I can't run anymore."</p>
<p>“我投降，”美悦子低语，喉咙里卡着一声虚假的啜泣。“我们……受伤了。陈快死了。我跑不动了。”</p>
<p>"Good," The Butcher laughed. "Bring me the codes. And bring yourself."</p>
<p>“很好，”屠夫大笑。“带上代码。还有带上你自己。”</p>
<p>"I'm at the Old Jesuit Ruins. North of the favela," she paused, making her voice tremble. "Please... just kill us quickly. Don't let your men... touch me."</p>
<p>“我在旧耶稣会遗址。贫民窟北边，”她停顿了一下，让声音发抖。“求你……给我们个痛快。别让你的人……碰我。”</p>
<p>"We will see," The Butcher hung up.</p>
<p>“到时候再说，”屠夫挂断了电话。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko lowered the phone. The tears vanished instantly. Her eyes were dry and cold as stones.</p>
<p>美悦子放下电话。眼泪瞬间消失。她的眼睛干涩、冷酷如石。</p>
<p>"He bought it," she looked at Chen Mo, who was wiring a block of C4 to a propane tank. "Greed makes men deaf."</p>
<p>“他信了，”她看着正在把C4炸药接在丙烷罐上的陈默。“贪婪让男人变聋。”</p>
<p>"He's coming with everything," Chen Mo checked the detonator. "Heavy armor. Maybe 20 men."</p>
<p>“他会倾巢而出，”陈默检查引爆器。“重型装甲。大概20个人。”</p>
<p>"Then we need a bigger fire," Miyetsuko hopped off the car. She walked over to Chen Mo, her bare feet silent on the moss. She ran a hand down his sweaty back. "Make it loud, Chen. I want to see them burn."</p>
<p>“那就需要更大的火，”美悦子跳下车。她走到陈默身边，赤脚踩在苔藓上悄无声息。她的手滑过他满是汗水的背脊。“弄得响一点，陈。我想看他们燃烧。”</p></div>
