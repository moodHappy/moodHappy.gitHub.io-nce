    <div class="meta">发布时间：2026/2/5 22:55:53</div>
    <div class="content"><p>The Reason</p>
<p>起因</p>
<p>1. The Verdict</p>
<p>判决</p>
<p>The voice on the phone was her oncologist.</p>
<p>电话里的那个声音是她的肿瘤科医生。</p>
<p>The test results had come back confirming the diagnosis.</p>
<p>检查结果回来了，确诊了。</p>
<p>The treatment plan was aggressive and immediate.</p>
<p>治疗方案很激进，而且要立刻开始。</p>
<p>It was not a suggestion; it was a schedule.</p>
<p>那不是建议，是一个时间表。</p>
<p>Her body was no longer just hers; it belonged to the protocol.</p>
<p>她的身体不再只属于她自己；它属于那套治疗方案了。</p>
<p>2. The Warning</p>
<p>预警</p>
<p>"You will likely lose your hair within the first three weeks," the doctor said.</p>
<p>“你很可能会在前三周内脱发，”医生说。</p>
<p>He spoke of follicles and toxicity.</p>
<p>他谈到了毛囊和毒性。</p>
<p>He described it as a side effect.</p>
<p>他把这描述为一种副作用。</p>
<p>To her, it sounded like an erasure.</p>
<p>对她来说，这听起来像是一种抹除。</p>
<p>He advised her to buy a wig before she needed one.</p>
<p>他建议她在需要之前先买好假发。</p>
<p>He said it helps with the transition.</p>
<p>他说这有助于过渡。</p>
<p>3. The Nightmare</p>
<p>噩梦</p>
<p>She imagined waking up to a pillow covered in dark webs.</p>
<p>她想象着醒来时，看到枕头上布满了黑色的网。</p>
<p>She imagined washing her hair and having clumps come away in her hands.</p>
<p>她想象着洗头时，成团的头发脱落在手里。</p>
<p>She imagined the slow, messy defeat of watching it fall.</p>
<p>她想象着看着它掉落时那种缓慢而狼狈的溃败。</p>
<p>That was a horror she refused to wait for.</p>
<p>那是她拒绝等待的恐惧。</p>
<p>She did not want the disease to take her hair.</p>
<p>她不想让疾病夺走她的头发。</p>
<p>4. The Logic</p>
<p>逻辑</p>
<p>If her hair was going to go, she would be the one to send it away.</p>
<p>如果头发终究要走，她要是那个送走它的人。</p>
<p>It was the only thing left she could control.</p>
<p>这是她仅剩的能掌控的事。</p>
<p>Cutting it was not an act of beauty.</p>
<p>剪发不是为了美。</p>
<p>It was a preemptive strike.</p>
<p>这是一种先发制人的打击。</p>
<p>She would rather look like a boy than a victim.</p>
<p>她宁愿看起来像个男孩，也不愿像个受害者。</p>
<p>By the time the medicine entered her veins, the hair would already be gone.</p>
<p>等到药物进入血管时，头发已经不在了。</p>
<p>She would not give the cancer the satisfaction of taking it from her.</p>
<p>她不会让癌症拥有从她身上夺走它的快感。</p></div>
