    <div class="content"><p>Mark from 3B</p>
<p>Mark lived in 3B because it was cheap and close to work.
He fixed pipes, doors, heaters—things people only noticed when they stopped working.</p>
<p>Most days were the same. He rode his bike, carried his toolbox, listened to complaints that weren’t really about buildings. He didn’t mind. Broken things made sense. You could see the problem. You could fix it or you couldn’t.</p>
<p>He noticed Lena early on.
Not because she talked—she didn’t—but because she didn’t ask for extra help. When something broke, she explained it clearly and stepped aside. No stories. No apologies.</p>
<p>Once, he saw her sister move in. The sofa bed came out. The hallway felt tighter. Mark had seen this before. Temporary, people said. Temporary always lasted longer than planned.</p>
<p>They talked sometimes. In the stairwell. By the door. About pipes. About bad coffee near the station. Mark liked that she didn’t push conversations forward. She let them end naturally.</p>
<p>After the sister left, the building felt quieter again. So did Lena.</p>
<p>One Saturday, Mark asked her about the café. He didn’t really care about the coffee. He just wanted to see if she might walk somewhere instead of staying still.</p>
<p>She answered honestly. He respected that.</p>
<p>They walked away in different directions.
Mark unlocked his bike and rode toward his next job.</p>
<p>Nothing had changed, really.
But later that night, while fixing a sink, he caught himself thinking about a quiet apartment above a closed tailor shop—and how some doors didn’t need to be opened to matter.</p></div>
