    <div class="content"><p>A Small Problem</p>
<p>I was already late when my phone died.</p>
<p>Not “low battery” dead.
Completely dead.</p>
<p>I stood at the bus stop, staring at the black screen, hoping it would magically turn back on.
It didn’t.</p>
<p>The bus arrived. I got on.</p>
<p>“Ticket?” the driver said.</p>
<p>“I—uh—my phone just died,” I said, holding it up like proof.</p>
<p>He looked at me. Then at the phone. Then back at me.</p>
<p>“That’s not my problem,” he said.</p>
<p>People behind me started to sigh.</p>
<p>“I’ll pay when I get off,” I said.
“I promise.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Rules are rules.”</p>
<p>For a second, I thought I’d have to get off and walk thirty minutes to work.</p>
<p>Then a woman behind me tapped my shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’ve got it,” she said, already handing him her card.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>She smiled. “Happens to everyone.”</p>
<p>I sat down, finally breathing again.</p>
<p>Two stops later, the bus stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>Traffic. Of course.</p>
<p>I checked the time on the screen above the driver.</p>
<p>Late. Still late.</p>
<p>When I finally ran into the office, my boss looked up.</p>
<p>“Rough morning?” he asked.</p>
<p>I nodded. “You have no idea.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “Coffee’s still hot.”</p>
<p>And just like that, the day didn’t feel so bad anymore.</p></div>
