    <div class="content"><p>Serious Suspicion</p>
<p>Mark started suspecting something was wrong on a Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nothing dramatic—no shouting, no blood, no mysterious notes. Just coffee.</p>
<p>He was sure he’d left the mug on his desk full. When he came back from the bathroom, it was half empty. Still warm.</p>
<p>He frowned at it for a long moment, then drank it anyway.</p>
<p>That night, he checked his phone.
Two steps on the health app.
All day.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible,” he muttered. He worked in a warehouse. He walked all the time.</p>
<p>The next morning, his shoelaces were tied differently. Not wrong—just not his way.</p>
<p>Mark stood in his hallway, staring down at his feet, his heart slowly speeding up.</p>
<p>Someone was in his apartment.</p>
<p>He didn’t call the police. He didn’t tell anyone. Instead, he decided to test it.</p>
<p>Before leaving for work, he placed a coin on the edge of the door, balanced carefully so it would fall if the door opened.</p>
<p>When he came home, the coin was gone.</p>
<p>Not on the floor. Not kicked aside. Gone.</p>
<p>That night, Mark didn’t sleep. He lay in bed, eyes open, listening.</p>
<p>At 3:12 a.m., he heard it.</p>
<p>A soft sound. Like fabric brushing fabric.</p>
<p>Breathing that wasn’t his.</p>
<p>He sat up slowly. “Hello?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>He turned on the light.</p>
<p>Nothing. Empty room. Normal walls. Normal mess.</p>
<p>The next day, he installed a cheap camera in the living room. Plugged it into his laptop. Let it record.</p>
<p>At work, his hands shook so badly he dropped a box.</p>
<p>That evening, he rushed home and opened the footage.</p>
<p>Hours of nothing.</p>
<p>Then, at 2:47 a.m., the screen flickered.</p>
<p>The camera showed Mark sleeping on the couch.</p>
<p>Then—movement.</p>
<p>The couch shifted.</p>
<p>Mark sat up on screen.</p>
<p>Scratched his head.</p>
<p>Stood up.</p>
<p>Walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p>The real Mark stared at the screen, cold spreading through his chest.</p>
<p>Because he remembered that night.</p>
<p>He never woke up.</p></div>
