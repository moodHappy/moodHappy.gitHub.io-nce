    <div class="content"><p>The Man on the Bench</p>
<p>He had been sitting there since dawn, though no one would have guessed it.</p>
<p>他从黎明就坐在这里，但没人会注意到。</p>
<p>His coat was frayed at the cuffs, his shoes dusty, and the newspaper in his hands folded the same way every day.</p>
<p>他的外套袖口磨损，鞋子布满灰尘，手里的报纸每天都折叠成同样的样子。</p>
<p>He glanced up occasionally, watching the platform fill with passengers and empty again.</p>
<p>他偶尔抬头，看着站台上人来人往，又渐渐空了。</p>
<p>When the woman by the board muttered under her breath, he heard nothing—though if he had, he wouldn’t have cared.</p>
<p>当发车牌旁的女人低声自语时，他什么也没听见——即便听见，也不会在意。</p>
<p>He marked a line in the paper, tapped the edge of the bench, and let the clock move him forward rather than himself.</p>
<p>他在报纸上划了一行，敲了敲长椅边缘，让时间推动他前行，而不是自己。</p>
<p>The train arrived, shoving people into motion. He stayed, watching her hesitate before stepping on.</p>
<p>火车到站，人群被冲动挤得动了起来。他依旧坐着，看着她犹豫着上车。</p>
<p>When it pulled away, he returned to the page he had left open, though the words no longer seemed to matter.</p>
<p>火车驶离时，他又回到翻开的报纸上，但文字已不再重要。</p>
<p>The platform emptied, the morning sun touching the edge of the benches, and he remained.</p>
<p>站台空了，晨光落在长椅边缘，而他依旧坐着。</p>
<p>No one noticed, but he noticed everything: the coat too heavy, the reflection in the glass, the faint echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>无人留意，但他注意到一切：过重的外套，玻璃里的倒影，轻微的脚步声。</p>
<p>He folded the paper, adjusted his coat, and waited for the next day to begin its motion again.</p>
<p>他折好报纸，整理外套，静静等待新一天再次启动。</p></div>
