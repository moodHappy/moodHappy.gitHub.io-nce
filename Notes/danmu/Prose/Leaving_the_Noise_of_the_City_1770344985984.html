<p>离开城市的喧闹</p>
<p>He took an early train to a coastal town where no one from the office would appear.</p>
<p>他坐清晨的火车去了一个沿海小镇，那里不会遇到公司的人。</p>
<p>The platform was quiet, and the wind carried the smell of salt and wet wood.</p>
<p>站台很安静，风里带着海盐和湿木头的味道。</p>
<p>He walked to a small guesthouse near the shore and checked in with a handwritten form.</p>
<p>他走到海边一间小旅馆，用手写登记表办理入住。</p>
<p>In the dining room, a woman was arranging cups for the morning guests.</p>
<p>餐厅里，一个女人正在给早来的客人摆放杯子。</p>
<p>She wore simple clothes, and her hair was tied loosely behind her neck.</p>
<p>她穿着简单的衣服，头发松松地扎在脖子后面。</p>
<p>When she turned to move a chair, he noticed the calm way she handled every object.</p>
<p>她转身挪动椅子时，他注意到她做每个动作都很从容。</p>
<p>She greeted him as a traveler, not as someone important.</p>
<p>她把他当普通旅客打招呼，而不是重要人物。</p>
<p>He ordered tea and sat near the window facing the sea.</p>
<p>他点了一杯茶，坐在面对大海的窗边。</p>
<p>Her husband arrived later with fresh bread from a nearby shop.</p>
<p>她的丈夫后来从附近面包店带回刚出炉的面包。</p>
<p>They spoke about the weather, the ferry schedule, and the number of visitors this season.</p>
<p>他们谈天气、渡船时间，还有这个季节的游客数量。</p>
<p>No one asked about his job or the city he came from.</p>
<p>没有人问他的工作，也没有人问他来自哪座城市。</p>
<p>In the afternoon, he walked along the shore and saw her hanging towels in the sun.</p>
<p>下午，他沿着海边走，看见她在阳光下晾毛巾。</p>
<p>She waved once, then continued her work without trying to talk longer.</p>
<p>她挥了一下手，又继续做事，没有多说。</p>
<p>The tide moved slowly, covering the footprints left by strangers.</p>
<p>潮水慢慢上涨，把陌生人留下的脚印盖住。</p>
<p>That evening, he returned to the guesthouse before the streetlights turned on.</p>
<p>傍晚路灯亮起前，他回到了旅馆。</p>
<p>She placed a simple dinner in front of him and reminded him the kitchen would close early.</p>
<p>她把一份简单的晚餐放到他面前，提醒厨房会早些关门。</p>
<p>He thanked her and ate quietly while the sound of waves entered through the open door.</p>
<p>他道谢后安静地吃饭，海浪声从敞开的门口传进来。</p>
<p>For the first time in months, nothing from the city followed him into the night.</p>
<p>这是几个月来，第一次没有任何城市里的事跟着他进入夜晚。</p></div>
