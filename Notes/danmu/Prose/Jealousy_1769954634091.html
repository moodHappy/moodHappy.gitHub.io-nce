    <div class="content"><p>Jealousy</p>
<p>Wang Jun didn’t think he was a jealous person.</p>
<p>He worked in the same logistics company for six years. Same desk, same route planning, same salary increase—tiny, but stable. He never complained much. Life was just like that.</p>
<p>Until Liu Wei arrived.</p>
<p>Liu Wei was five years younger, spoke loudly, laughed easily, and somehow knew how to please everyone. Within three months, he was having lunch with the manager. Within six, he was leading a small team.</p>
<p>Wang Jun noticed the changes slowly.</p>
<p>The manager stopped asking him first. Meetings ended with “Let Liu handle it.” When bonuses were announced, Liu Wei’s name was always near the top.</p>
<p>“It’s just because he’s new,” Wang Jun told himself.</p>
<p>One evening, Wang Jun stayed late to finish a report. Liu Wei passed by, coat on, keys in hand.</p>
<p>“Still working?” Liu Wei said. “Don’t overdo it.”</p>
<p>Wang Jun forced a smile. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>After Liu left, Wang Jun stared at the screen. The numbers blurred. His chest felt tight, like something heavy was sitting there.</p>
<p>At home, his wife was watching TV.</p>
<p>“Liu Wei got promoted again today,” she said casually. “I heard it from my cousin. He works in your company, right?”</p>
<p>Wang Jun froze. “You talk about him now too?”</p>
<p>His wife looked surprised. “What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.” He went to the bathroom and closed the door.</p>
<p>He looked at himself in the mirror. Same face. Same tired eyes. Six years, and still here.</p>
<p>The next day, Liu Wei made a small mistake—sent a file to the wrong client. It was fixable. Not serious.</p>
<p>Wang Jun noticed it immediately.</p>
<p>For a moment, he said nothing.</p>
<p>His fingers hovered over the keyboard. If he stayed quiet, Liu Wei would take the blame. The manager would finally see it.</p>
<p>The thought made his heart beat faster.</p>
<p>Then the client called, angry.</p>
<p>Wang Jun sighed and stood up. “That was my fault,” he said. “I’ll fix it.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at him. Liu Wei turned, shocked.</p>
<p>Later, Liu Wei came over. “Thanks,” he said quietly. “I owe you one.”</p>
<p>Wang Jun nodded.</p>
<p>That night, lying in bed, Wang Jun still felt uneasy. The jealousy didn’t disappear. It never really does.</p>
<p>But at least, he knew he hadn’t become someone he hated.</p></div>
