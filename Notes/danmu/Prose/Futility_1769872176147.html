<p>Mark spent three months fixing a clock no one used.</p>
<p>It hung on the wall of a small bus station café, right above the menu that hadn’t changed since 2012. The clock had stopped at 6:40 long before Mark started working there, frozen like it was making a point.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother with it,” his boss, Helen, said on his first day. “Everyone checks their phones.”</p>
<p>Mark nodded, but the silence of that dead clock bothered him. Every tick that never came felt wrong.</p>
<p>So after closing time, he stayed.</p>
<p>He brought in a screwdriver from home. Then a magnifying glass. Then a tiny bottle of oil. Each night, he opened the clock, adjusted something, put it back, and waited.</p>
<p>Sometimes it moved. Once, it ran for almost a whole hour before stopping again.</p>
<p>Mark smiled that night like he’d won something.</p>
<p>During the day, life went on as usual. Commuters rushed in, ordered coffee, complained about delays. Someone always asked, “Is this the last bus?” Someone was always late anyway.</p>
<p>Nobody noticed the clock.</p>
<p>One afternoon, a man in a wrinkled coat stared at it and said, “That thing’s been wrong for years.”</p>
<p>Mark said, “I’m working on it.”</p>
<p>The man laughed. “Why?”</p>
<p>Mark didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Weeks passed. The seasons shifted slightly—less light in the evenings, colder wind sneaking through the door. Mark’s hands smelled permanently of metal and oil.</p>
<p>One night, after a long shift, he finally heard it.</p>
<p>Tick.</p>
<p>Tick.</p>
<p>The clock moved steadily, confidently, as if it had never been broken.</p>
<p>Mark sat under it, watching the second hand circle again and again. He checked his phone. The time matched perfectly.</p>
<p>He felt absurdly proud.</p>
<p>The next morning, the café was louder than usual. Helen was arguing with a technician.</p>
<p>“They’re replacing it,” she said when she saw Mark. “New digital display. Comes with the renovation.”</p>
<p>The old clock lay on the counter, face cracked, battery removed.</p>
<p>Mark stared at it. “It was working,” he said.</p>
<p>Helen shrugged. “Didn’t need it.”</p>
<p>That night, Mark took the clock home. He hung it above his desk. It ticked faithfully, keeping perfect time in a room where no one ever asked for it.</p>
<p>Weeks later, it stopped again.</p>
<p>Mark replaced the battery. Cleaned the gears. Adjusted the hands.</p>
<p>It didn’t start.</p>
<p>He sat there for a long time, then quietly put the clock in a drawer.</p>
<p>The next morning, he woke up late, rushed out the door, and checked his phone for the time—like everyone else.</p></div>
