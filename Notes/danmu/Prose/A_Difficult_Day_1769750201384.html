    <div class="content"><p>A Difficult Day</p>
<p>I woke up already tired.</p>
<p>Nothing terrible had happened, but nothing felt right either. My alarm rang three times before I finally got out of bed. The room was cold, and the sky outside looked the same dull gray as my mood.</p>
<p>On the way to work, the bus was late. Again. I checked my phone, hoping for a message that might change the day somehow, but there was nothing—just the same notifications, the same silence.</p>
<p>At work, small problems piled up. A file went missing. A meeting dragged on with no clear point. Someone asked me a question I should have known the answer to, and for a moment, my mind went completely blank. I smiled anyway.</p>
<p>By afternoon, everything felt heavier than it should have. Even simple tasks took more effort. I told myself, Just get through today. That’s enough.</p>
<p>On the way home, it started to rain. I didn’t run. I just walked and let it happen.</p>
<p>At night, I lay in bed, thinking about all the things I hadn’t fixed, hadn’t said, hadn’t become. Then I took a deep breath and turned off the light.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I told myself, I’ll try again.</p></div>
