    <div class="content"><p>The Marriage Before</p>
<p>Before the apartment above the tailor shop, before the stairs and the plants and the quiet she could account for, Lena had lived with a man who took up space without noticing he was doing so.</p>
<p>His name was Daniel. They met the way many things begin—through proximity rather than intention. A shared friend’s dinner, a few overlapping commutes, the sense that conversation with him required no effort. He spoke easily, filled pauses before they had time to settle. At first, Lena mistook that for warmth.</p>
<p>They married after three years. Not because of urgency, but because it seemed like the next reasonable step. Their apartment then was larger, newer, with thin walls and a balcony that overlooked a busy street. Daniel liked to keep the windows open. Noise made him feel alive.</p>
<p>In the early months, Lena adjusted. She learned to narrate her thoughts before silence could take hold, learned that questions left unanswered would be answered for her. Daniel talked through meals, through movies, through the small rituals she’d once performed quietly. When she withdrew, he noticed—but only enough to comment on it.</p>
<p>“You’re quiet today,” he would say, as if it were a temporary condition.
“I’m fine,” she’d answer, because explaining took more energy than it saved.</p>
<p>There was no cruelty in him. That was what made it difficult to name what was wrong. He remembered birthdays, fixed things promptly, introduced her proudly to colleagues. From the outside, the marriage worked. From the inside, it felt constantly interrupted.</p>
<p>Arguments, when they came, were soft and unresolved. Daniel wanted reasons; Lena had only accumulations. He believed problems announced themselves clearly. She knew better. Some things eroded.</p>
<p>She began to notice how she waited for him to leave before feeling fully present in her own home. How she folded herself smaller—not out of fear, but efficiency. How she stopped inviting friends over because the conversations never stayed where she put them.</p>
<p>When friends later asked when it went wrong, Lena couldn’t point to a moment. There was no betrayal, no shouted sentence, no slammed door. The marriage didn’t break. It thinned.</p>
<p>Days passed where they spoke only in logistics. Weeks where her name sounded unfamiliar in his mouth. Evenings where she lay awake beside him, listening to traffic through the open window, calculating how much quiet existed elsewhere.</p>
<p>When she finally said she wanted to live alone, Daniel was genuinely surprised. He asked what he could fix. She told him there was nothing broken—only something no longer there.</p>
<p>The separation was orderly. Papers signed. Boxes packed. He kept the balcony. She kept nothing but her books and the habit of noticing when space felt right.</p>
<p>Afterward, people told her she would miss companionship. They said silence could be dangerous. Lena didn’t argue. She simply learned, over time, the difference between being alone and being crowded.</p>
<p>By the time she moved into the apartment with no elevator, she no longer confused peace with emptiness. She understood that sharing space was not a virtue in itself—and that sometimes, the most faithful thing you could do for a life was to give it room to breathe.</p></div>
