    <div class="content"><p>Depending on Hope</p>
<p>Every morning, I wake up and check my phone.
I don’t know exactly what I’m expecting, but I’m definitely expecting something.</p>
<p>Sometimes I expect a message.
Sometimes I expect good news.
And sometimes, I just expect the day to be a little easier than yesterday.</p>
<p>I rely on small things more than I’d like to admit.
A warm cup of coffee.
A quiet bus ride.
Someone saying, “It’s going to be okay,” even if they’re not sure.</p>
<p>There are days when I realize I’m really just depending on hope.
Not a big dream.
Not a clear plan.
Just the hope that things won’t get worse.</p>
<p>I used to expect too much from people.
I thought if I waited long enough, someone would understand me completely.
But life doesn’t work that way.
People are busy.
People are tired.
People have their own problems.</p>
<p>So now, I try to expect less from others and rely more on myself.
I still hope.
I still wait.
But I don’t put all my weight on one person or one moment.</p>
<p>Depending on something is not a bad thing.
We all do it.
The trick is knowing what to depend on — and when to let go.</p></div>
