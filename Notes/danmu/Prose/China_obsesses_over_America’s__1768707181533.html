It resonated with many in China. State media regularly portray America as a deeply unequal, dangerous country. But the kill line phrase was fresh, even edgy. Many of the Seattle student’s live streams were censored by Bilibili for their graphic nature. Yet in the whirling ecosystem of Chinese social media, others made posts about his posts, and within days the “US kill line” had become widely known. Commenters marshalled evidence of the American hellscape. They recycled stories of people needing urgent care who refused ambulances because of their cost and of well-paid software engineers who lost their jobs and wound up homeless.<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p><p data-tts="1">By late December officials noticed that they had a winning message. State media started to produce serious pieces about the kill line, armed with data. Many noted that some 770,000 Americans are now homeless. They also referred to a Federal Reserve report that 37% of American adults cannot cover a $400 emergency expense with their savings. And some cited a new estimate that an American family of four needs an eye-watering $137,000 annually to stay out of poverty. On January 4th even Qiushi, a leading Communist Party journal, published its interpretation, writing that the kill line reflects America’s “institutional arrangements that systematically place capital security and returns ahead of workers’ survival and dignity”.<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p><p data-tts="1">No doubt life can be tough in America. But the kill line greatly overstates the fragility of existence there. Homelessness is a stain on the country, but it remains an extreme outcome, affecting less than 0.05% of the population on a chronic basis. As for those who struggle to cover emergency expenses, analyses that factor in deferred discretionary spending put the number at about 10%, not 37%. And economists have thoroughly debunked the claim that $137,000 marks America’s true poverty line. Families can, and do, get by on much less.<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p><p data-tts="1">But the Chinese fascination reveals something telling about their own worries. In an online essay last month, Wei Zhou, an author using a pen name, argued that the upswell in discussion about America’s deficiencies stemmed partly from China’s own anxieties about its slowing growth. Although censors often curtail criticism of China, “one can talk freely under the guise of discussing America”, he wrote. Some commentators may not be doing this deliberately but rather engaging in a form of psychological projection, or “talking about others while thinking about oneself”, as Wei Zhou put it.<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p><p data-tts="1">People in China have much to be glum about these days. Property owners have seen the values of their homes fall by about 20% from their peak five years ago. University graduates are entering a forbidding job market, with the youth unemployment rate at 17%. Blue-collar workers are eking out tiny wage gains, a sharp regression from the heady norm of the previous decade.<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p><p data-tts="1">But are single misfortunes somehow less devastating in China than in America? It depends. To China’s credit, its medical and drug costs are lower than the sky-high charges in America, so illnesses or accidents may be less damaging financially. (A bigger problem is the availability of good health care, especially in smaller cities.) Business failures, by contrast, can be debilitating. Without well-developed personal-bankruptcy laws, it is much harder to recover from bad investments in China than in America. China is not safe from a kill line: it just shows up in other ways.<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p><p data-tts="1">Locked in
In any case, the kill line implies that people have already lost a good deal. Americans mostly fear being knocked down a few rungs of the economic ladder when disasters occur. In China many are fighting to gain a foothold in the first place. Parents and teachers heap pressure on children from a young age to perform well in tests. Companies in every sector compete ferociously, only to see their profit margins collapse. Workers put in long hours but find that intense effort is met with diminishing returns. All the while the economy is sagging, eroding the opportunities that once seemed boundless.<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p><p data-tts="1">A recent study in the China Leadership Monitor, an online journal published by the Hoover Institution in California, points to a dramatic slowdown in the growth of China’s middle-income population since 2018. Unsurprisingly, surveys have also detected a clear rise in pessimism over the past decade. The gloom is less about the risk of precipitous decline than a sense of creeping stagnation. Gamers have a term for this, too. For China, the hazard is not so much the kill line but ruansuo, or “softlock”—a predicament when players are trapped alive but can no longer progress, no matter how hard they try.■<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p><p data-tts="1">Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our Opinion newsletter, which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence<span class="para-read-btn" title="朗读此段"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="11 5 6 9 2 9 2 15 6 15 11 19 11 5"></polygon><path d="M19.07 4.93a10 10 0 0 1 0 14.14M15.54 8.46a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07"></path></svg></span></p>
