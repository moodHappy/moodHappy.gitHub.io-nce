    <div class="content"><p>Nasal Congestion</p>
<p>鼻塞</p>
<p>He woke up before the alarm because he could not breathe through his nose.</p>
<p>他在闹钟响之前醒了，因为鼻子不通气。</p>
<p>The room smelled faintly of dust and last night’s rain drifting in through the cracked window.</p>
<p>房间里有一股淡淡的灰尘味，还有昨晚雨水从窗缝里带进来的潮气。</p>
<p>He lay still, testing each nostril like checking two doors.</p>
<p>他躺着不动，像检查两扇门一样试着用左右鼻孔呼吸。</p>
<p>The left one worked a little.
The right one was completely blocked.</p>
<p>左边还能勉强通气。
右边彻底堵死了。</p>
<p>He rolled onto his side. The blockage shifted, not gone, just relocated.</p>
<p>他翻了个身，堵塞感跟着移动了位置，没有消失，只是换了地方。</p>
<p>That annoyed him more than if it had stayed the same.</p>
<p>这反而更让他烦躁。</p>
<p>He thought of calling in sick, but it felt dishonest. His body was uncomfortable, not ill.</p>
<p>他想过请病假，但又觉得不太对。他只是难受，不是真的生病。</p>
<p>In the bathroom mirror, his face looked normal. Slightly swollen eyes. A red nose tip.</p>
<p>浴室镜子里的脸看起来很正常。眼睛有点肿，鼻尖发红。</p>
<p>Nothing dramatic enough to explain anything to anyone.</p>
<p>不足以向任何人解释什么。</p>
<p>He boiled water and leaned over the steam. The warmth softened his face, fogged his glasses.</p>
<p>他烧了热水，低头对着蒸汽。热气让脸放松下来，眼镜起了雾。</p>
<p>For a few seconds, air flowed freely.</p>
<p>有那么几秒钟，空气顺畅地进出。</p>
<p>Then it closed again, quietly, without asking.</p>
<p>随后又悄悄堵上了，没有征求他的意见。</p>
<p>On the bus, he breathed through his mouth. His throat dried out.</p>
<p>在公交车上，他只能用嘴呼吸，喉咙很快干了。</p>
<p>A woman next to him sniffed once and moved her bag closer.</p>
<p>旁边的女人吸了下鼻子，把包往自己这边挪了挪。</p>
<p>He wanted to say it was just nasal congestion, nothing contagious.</p>
<p>他想解释只是鼻塞，不传染。</p>
<p>He said nothing.</p>
<p>他什么也没说。</p>
<p>At work, words came out slightly wrong. Not incorrect, just heavier.</p>
<p>在工作中，说出口的话有点变形。不是错了，只是变得沉重。</p>
<p>He noticed people waited an extra beat before replying.</p>
<p>他发现别人回答前，总会多停顿一拍。</p>
<p>By noon, the pressure behind his eyes grew dull and steady.</p>
<p>中午时分，眼眶后的压力变得迟钝而持续。</p>
<p>He pressed the bridge of his nose with two fingers.</p>
<p>他用两根手指按着鼻梁。</p>
<p>The relief was minimal but convincing enough to repeat.</p>
<p>缓解很轻微，但足以让他反复去按。</p>
<p>He ate soup for lunch. Hot, salty, bland.</p>
<p>午饭他喝了汤，热的，咸的，很淡。</p>
<p>Steam rose again. Another brief opening.</p>
<p>蒸汽再次升起，又是一次短暂的通畅。</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and stayed there longer than necessary.</p>
<p>他闭着眼，多停留了一会儿。</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the congestion settled in as if it had decided to stay.</p>
<p>下午，鼻塞像是下定了决心，不打算走了。</p>
<p>He stopped fighting it.</p>
<p>他不再试图对抗。</p>
<p>On the way home, he bought tissues, nasal spray, and nothing else.</p>
<p>回家路上，他买了纸巾、喷鼻剂，别的什么都没买。</p>
<p>At night, lying in bed, he breathed carefully, slowly.</p>
<p>夜里躺在床上，他小心而缓慢地呼吸。</p>
<p>One nostril open. One closed.</p>
<p>一边通，一边堵。</p>
<p>He accepted the imbalance.</p>
<p>他接受了这种不对称。</p>
<p>Sleep came unevenly, but it came.</p>
<p>睡眠来得断断续续，但还是来了。</p>
<p>By morning, it would probably be better.</p>
<p>到早上，大概会好一点。</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>也可能不会。</p>
<p>Either way, he would get up.</p>
<p>不管怎样，他都会起床。</p></div>
