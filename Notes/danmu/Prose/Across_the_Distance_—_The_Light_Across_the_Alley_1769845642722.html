<p>That night didn’t slow down.</p>
<p>They barely made it inside before the door closed behind them. Shoes were kicked aside. Words were unfinished. Whatever distance had once protected them collapsed all at once.</p>
<p>By morning, the rain had stopped. The city felt washed clean. Anna lay awake, watching Mark sleep, surprised by how quickly something imagined had turned into something real—and how real things were harder to hold.</p>
<p>They didn’t talk about love.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Two months later, Mark took a job outside the city.</p>
<p>“It’s temporary,” he said, standing in her kitchen, suitcase open. “Three weeks at a time. Good pay.”</p>
<p>Anna nodded. She smiled when she was supposed to. She helped him fold shirts.</p>
<p>The alley light still came on at 10:47.</p>
<p>Mark promised to call every night. He mostly did.</p>
<p>At first, Anna waited for those calls the way she once waited for the light. She planned her evenings around them. She stayed in. She read by the window again.</p>
<p>But windows work both ways.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>It started small.</p>
<p>A coworker offering to walk her home.
A drink that turned into two.
A hand resting too long on the back of her chair.</p>
<p>Anna told herself it was harmless. She wasn’t doing anything. Just talking.</p>
<p>Just being seen.</p>
<p>The city felt larger without Mark. Louder. Less forgiving. And in that noise, it was easy to forget the quiet promise of someone far away.</p>
<p>One night, she didn’t answer Mark’s call.</p>
<p>She texted later. Sorry, fell asleep.</p>
<p>He replied with a heart emoji.</p>
<p>She stared at it longer than she should have.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The affair—if that’s what it was—never felt dramatic. No grand lies. No secret hotels.</p>
<p>Just moments that slid past the line without announcing themselves.</p>
<p>A kiss in the hallway.
A night she didn’t go home alone.
A morning she avoided her own reflection.</p>
<p>Anna was careful.</p>
<p>Mark remained untouched by suspicion. His voice on the phone stayed warm, familiar. When he came back into town, he brought groceries, small gifts, stories from the road.</p>
<p>He still looked at her the same way.</p>
<p>That was the hardest part.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>One evening, Mark stood at the window again, looking down into the alley.</p>
<p>“Do you ever think about how this started?” he asked.</p>
<p>Anna poured wine, her hands steady. “Sometimes.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “Funny. I used to think distance made things safer.”</p>
<p>She met his eyes.</p>
<p>“Does it?” she asked.</p>
<p>Mark shook his head. “No. I think it just makes it easier to hide.”</p>
<p>Anna said nothing.</p>
<p>The light across the alley came on right on time.</p>
<p>And from the outside, everything still looked exactly the same.</p></div>
