<p>They checked in arguing.</p>
<p>Not loudly—just enough to feel it. The kind of argument that had been going on for days, maybe weeks, and no longer needed volume to stay alive.</p>
<p>The man walked ahead, pulling the suitcase too fast. The woman followed, arms crossed, phone clenched in her hand like evidence.</p>
<p>Room 615.</p>
<p>Inside, the room was smaller than expected. One bed. One chair. The air smelled faintly of detergent and something sweet gone stale.</p>
<p>“You could’ve booked a better place,” she said.</p>
<p>“For one night?” he replied. “It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you always say. ‘It’s fine.’”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer. He sat on the edge of the bed and started untying his shoes, slow, deliberate. She paced near the window, pulling the curtain open, then closed again.</p>
<p>They had come for a wedding. His cousin’s. A city neither of them liked, spending money neither of them wanted to spend. The fight had started in the car, over directions, then drifted into everything else—work, family, old promises.</p>
<p>Later, they ate cold sandwiches from a convenience store. The TV was on, volume low. Neither of them watched.</p>
<p>“You didn’t even ask how my meeting went,” she said.</p>
<p>“You didn’t want to talk,” he said.</p>
<p>“I wanted you to ask.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>At midnight, the argument finally broke through the walls. Not shouting—sharp whispers, words cutting close.</p>
<p>“I’m tired,” she said. “Of always being the one who cares.”</p>
<p>“I do care,” he said. “I just don’t do it the way you want.”</p>
<p>She laughed once, short and bitter.</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>He stood up, grabbed his jacket.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Downstairs. To get some air.”</p>
<p>The door closed behind him, softer than she expected.</p>
<p>She sat on the bed alone, scrolling through her phone without seeing anything. Ten minutes passed. Twenty.</p>
<p>He came back smelling like cold night air and cigarettes, even though he’d quit years ago.</p>
<p>They didn’t talk.</p>
<p>In the morning, they woke up facing opposite directions. The wedding was in three hours. They would smile in photos, raise glasses, tell people they were doing well.</p>
<p>As they checked out, the receptionist wished them a nice day.</p>
<p>They said “you too” at the same time.</p>
<p>For a moment, they almost laughed.</p>
<p>Almost.</p></div>
