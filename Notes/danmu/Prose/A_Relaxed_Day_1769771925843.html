    <div class="content"><p>A Relaxed Day</p>
<p>I woke up without an alarm.</p>
<p>Sunlight came through the window, soft and warm. For once, I didn’t rush. I stayed in bed for a few minutes, just listening to the quiet.</p>
<p>Breakfast was simple—coffee and toast—but it tasted better when I wasn’t in a hurry. I checked my phone, scrolled a little, then put it down. Nothing urgent. That felt nice.</p>
<p>During the day, things went smoothly. No big wins, no big problems. I finished my work, took a short walk, and noticed small things I usually ignored—the sound of leaves, the slow movement of clouds.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I did something just for myself. I read a few pages of a book and stopped when I felt like it, not because I had to.</p>
<p>At night, I went to bed feeling light. Not excited, not exhausted—just calm.</p>
<p>Some days don’t need to be special. Being easy is enough.</p></div>
