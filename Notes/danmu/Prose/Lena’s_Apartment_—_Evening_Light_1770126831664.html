<p>莉娜的公寓 · 傍晚的光</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Lena came home later than usual that evening.
那天傍晚，莉娜回家得比平时晚。</p>
<p>The stairwell lights were already on, casting a yellow glow that made everything look older than it was.
楼道的灯已经亮起，昏黄的光让一切看上去都比实际更旧。</p>
<p>She paused on the third floor, not because she was tired, but because someone was standing below, searching for keys.
她在三楼停了一下，不是因为累了，而是因为下面有人正低头找钥匙。</p>
<p>The man muttered under his breath, patting his coat pockets, then his bag.
那男人低声嘀咕着，拍了拍外套口袋，又翻了翻包。</p>
<p>Lena watched without moving.
莉娜站着没动。</p>
<p>There had been a time when she would have offered help.
曾经，她是会出声帮忙的。</p>
<p>Now she waited for things to resolve themselves.
现在，她更习惯等事情自己结束。</p>
<p>After a minute, the man straightened, keys finally in hand, relief crossing his face.
过了一会儿，男人直起身，终于找到了钥匙，脸上掠过一丝轻松。</p>
<p>He glanced up and noticed her.
他抬头，看见了她。</p>
<p>“Evening,” he said, as if they were already acquainted.
“晚上好。”他说，语气像是他们早就认识。</p>
<p>“Evening,” Lena replied, neutral and brief.
“晚上好。”莉娜回应，平静而简短。</p>
<p>They passed each other on the stairs without slowing down.
他们在楼梯上擦肩而过，没有放慢脚步。</p>
<p>Only when she reached her apartment did Lena realize she had been holding her breath.
直到走进公寓，莉娜才意识到自己刚才一直屏着呼吸。</p>
<p>She set her bag down, turned on the lamp, and let the room fill with a softer light.
她放下包，打开台灯，让更柔和的光填满房间。</p>
<p>Whatever the man had needed, he had managed on his own.
不管那男人需要什么，他已经自己解决了。</p>
<p>This, she told herself, was how things worked now.
她对自己说，现在事情就是这样运转的。</p></div>
