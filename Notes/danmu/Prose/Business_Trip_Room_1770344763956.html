    <div class="content"><p>Business Trip Room</p>
<p>出差同住一室</p>
<p>The train arrived at the city just before sunset.</p>
<p>火车在日落前到达这座城市。</p>
<p>She walked ahead of me with a small black suitcase.</p>
<p>她拖着一个黑色小行李箱走在我前面。</p>
<p>I had imagined this trip many times, but the street looked ordinary.</p>
<p>我想象过这次出差很多次，但这条街看起来很普通。</p>
<p>The hotel stood beside a convenience store and a closed bakery.</p>
<p>酒店旁边是一家便利店和一间关门的面包店。</p>
<p>She checked the booking on her phone at the front desk.</p>
<p>她在前台用手机确认预订信息。</p>
<p>The clerk said only one room was left because of a conference.</p>
<p>前台说因为有会议只剩下一间房。</p>
<p>She paused for two seconds and then nodded.</p>
<p>她停顿了两秒，然后点头。</p>
<p>I kept my eyes on the floor tiles and said nothing.</p>
<p>我盯着地砖，没有说话。</p>
<p>The room had two narrow beds pushed close together.</p>
<p>房间里有两张靠得很近的窄床。</p>
<p>A single window faced the parking lot behind the building.</p>
<p>唯一的窗户对着楼后的停车场。</p>
<p>She put her suitcase near the wall and took off her coat.</p>
<p>她把行李箱放在墙边，脱下外套。</p>
<p>I placed my bag beside the desk and waited for instructions.</p>
<p>我把包放在书桌旁，等她开口安排。</p>
<p>She said we should review the client files before dinner.</p>
<p>她说晚饭前先把客户资料再看一遍。</p>
<p>We sat at the small table with our shoulders almost touching.</p>
<p>我们坐在小桌旁，肩膀几乎碰在一起。</p>
<p>Her voice stayed calm while she explained the schedule.</p>
<p>她用平静的语气说明第二天的安排。</p>
<p>I wrote notes slowly to hide my nervous hands.</p>
<p>我写得很慢，好让发抖的手不被看见。</p>
<p>When she leaned over to point at a line, her hair brushed my sleeve.</p>
<p>她俯身指文件时，头发擦过我的袖子。</p>
<p>Neither of us mentioned it, and she continued speaking.</p>
<p>我们都没有提起，她继续往下说。</p>
<p>After the meeting plan was finished, she closed the folder.</p>
<p>计划讲完后，她把文件夹合上。</p>
<p>She asked if I wanted noodles or rice for dinner.</p>
<p>她问我晚饭想吃面还是米饭。</p>
<p>We bought two simple meals from the shop downstairs.</p>
<p>我们在楼下买了两份很普通的便当。</p>
<p>Back in the room, the television played low news sounds.</p>
<p>回到房间，电视里放着很小声的新闻。</p>
<p>She sat on her bed to answer work messages.</p>
<p>她坐在床上回复工作消息。</p>
<p>I stood by the window and watched cars leave the parking lot.</p>
<p>我站在窗边看车一辆一辆离开停车场。</p>
<p>The room grew quiet after ten o’clock.</p>
<p>十点以后房间慢慢安静下来。</p>
<p>She turned off the main light and kept the desk lamp on.</p>
<p>她关掉顶灯，只留下一盏台灯。</p>
<p>Soft yellow light covered half of her face.</p>
<p>柔黄的灯光落在她半边脸上。</p>
<p>She said we needed to wake up at six.</p>
<p>她说明天六点要起床。</p>
<p>I said I understood and lay down on my bed.</p>
<p>我说知道了，然后躺到自己的床上。</p>
<p>The distance between the two beds was less than one step.</p>
<p>两张床之间不到一步的距离。</p>
<p>I could hear her breathing after the lamp was turned off.</p>
<p>台灯关掉后，我能听见她的呼吸声。</p>
<p>No one spoke again before sleep came.</p>
<p>入睡前我们再没有说话。</p></div>
