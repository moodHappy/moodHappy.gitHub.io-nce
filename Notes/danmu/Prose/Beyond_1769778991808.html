    <div class="content"><p>Beyond</p>
<p>I missed my stop again.</p>
<p>Not by accident this time.
I saw the sign coming, counted down in my head, and still stayed in my seat.</p>
<p>The bus rolled past it like nothing mattered.</p>
<p>A guy next to me glanced over.
“Didn’t you need that stop?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I just… felt like going a little further.”</p>
<p>He nodded, like that made sense. On public transport, it always does.</p>
<p>My phone buzzed.
Where are you?
I typed, Almost there, even though I wasn’t.</p>
<p>Outside, the streets slowly changed. Fewer shops. More houses. Quieter.</p>
<p>When the bus finally stopped, I got off and stood there for a moment. Cold air, empty road, no rush.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don’t miss things.
Sometimes you go beyond them on purpose.</p></div>
