    <div class="content"><p>The Tailor Shop</p>
<p>The old tailor shop hadn’t been open for months, but it didn’t seem to notice. Its windows were dusty, mannequins draped in unfinished garments, seams still pinned in place as if waiting for hands that would never return. The bell above the door had long since stopped jingling; the world moved on, but the shop stayed the same.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, the tailor, spent most of his days upstairs in the small apartment he had built above the store. The renovation next door, the occasional footsteps on the stairs, the distant hum of trams—he noticed everything, even when it seemed irrelevant.</p>
<p>He had run the shop for decades. Suits, dresses, uniforms—nothing too fancy, nothing too cheap. Customers came and went, some staying a week, a month, a year. He remembered each one by the way they held fabric, by the hesitation before choosing buttons. Patterns of human behavior, he thought, weren’t so different from patterns of thread.</p>
<p>When the building’s plumbing failed, he didn’t move. Pipes rattled, faucets dripped, walls smelled faintly of damp. The shop had survived worse. Mr. Chen kept the scissors on their hooks, the chalk dusted neatly on the counter, the measuring tapes curled like sleeping snakes.</p>
<p>Sometimes he watched the building from his window. A woman carrying grocery bags passed the entrance—the one from a few weeks ago—her steps hurried, her hands strained by the plastic handles. She never looked up. He smiled faintly. People passed, people paused, lives brushed together without knowing.</p>
<p>He wasn’t lonely. The store was company enough. A sleeve pinned to a mannequin, a row of buttons catching the afternoon sun—there was a quiet dialogue there, more honest than conversation. And sometimes, when he measured a new piece of cloth, he imagined the shape it would take, imagined the hands that would guide it, imagined the person who might wear it someday.</p>
<p>One evening, a young man from the apartment above—Lena’s sister’s husband, though he didn’t know it yet—paused outside. He looked at the faded sign: Chen’s Tailoring. Something in the way the window reflected the streetlight caught his eye, and he lingered for a moment. Then he moved on, leaving the bell silent.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen returned to the shop counter, pressed his palm against the worn wood. The threads, the fabric, the quiet presence of the place—it all waited. He had no idea if anyone would return. Perhaps someone would. Perhaps not. But for now, it didn’t matter. The tailor and his shop, as they always had, simply existed together, folding life into careful seams, invisible yet persistent.</p>
<p>Somewhere above, the apartment hummed. People lived. People paused. People left. The shop remained. Always, in the background, it remained.</p></div>
