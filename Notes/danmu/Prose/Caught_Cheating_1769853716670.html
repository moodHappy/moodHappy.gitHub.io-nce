    <div class="content"><p>Caught Cheating</p>
<p>I thought I was being careful.</p>
<p>The exam room was silent except for pens scratching paper. I had written a few formulas on a small piece of paper and tucked it into my sleeve. I told myself I’d only look once. Just once.</p>
<p>Halfway through the test, my mind went blank. Panic crept in. I slowly pulled my sleeve down and glanced.</p>
<p>That’s when I felt it.</p>
<p>A shadow stopped beside my desk.</p>
<p>“Stand up,” the teacher said quietly.</p>
<p>My heart dropped. The room suddenly felt too bright. Everyone looked up.</p>
<p>“What’s in your sleeve?” she asked.</p>
<p>I tried to smile. “Nothing.”</p>
<p>She reached out. The paper slid onto the floor.</p>
<p>No one laughed. That was worse.</p>
<p>“Exam over,” she said. “Come with me.”</p>
<p>In the hallway, she didn’t yell. That made it even harder.</p>
<p>“Why?” she asked.</p>
<p>I stared at my shoes. “I didn’t study enough.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “That’s not a reason. That’s a choice.”</p>
<p>The result was simple: zero on the exam, a note sent home.</p>
<p>That night, I sat at my desk with my books open. Not because I had to—but because next time, I didn’t want to be afraid of a shadow.</p></div>
