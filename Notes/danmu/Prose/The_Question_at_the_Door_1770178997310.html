<p>门口的问题</p>
<p>She leaned against the doorframe, the light behind her low and warm.</p>
<p>她靠在门框上，身后的灯光压得很低，很暖。</p>
<p>The air smelled of soap and heat, the kind that lingers on skin after a shower.</p>
<p>空气里有肥皂味和热气，是洗过澡后留在皮肤上的那种。</p>
<p>He had not planned to stay. He had planned to leave five minutes ago.</p>
<p>他本来没打算留下。本来五分钟前就该走。</p>
<p>She lifted her chin, slow, deliberate, letting the silence stretch.</p>
<p>她慢慢抬起下巴，很刻意，让沉默被拉长。</p>
<p>“Do you like my new thong?” she said.</p>
<p>“你喜欢我的新丁字裤吗？”她说。</p>
<p>The words were light. The room was not.</p>
<p>话很轻，房间却不是。</p>
<p>He looked at her legs first, then forced his eyes back to her face.</p>
<p>他先看了她的腿，又强迫自己把视线拉回她的脸。</p>
<p>The fabric was barely there, black against skin, a private detail made public on purpose.</p>
<p>布料几乎不存在，黑色贴着皮肤，一个被故意展示出来的私密细节。</p>
<p>He swallowed. The clock on the wall ticked once, loud enough to count.</p>
<p>他咽了口唾沫。墙上的钟走了一下，响得能数清。</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t ask me that,” he said.</p>
<p>“你不该问我这个。”他说。</p>
<p>She smiled, small and sharp, as if that was exactly the point.</p>
<p>她笑了一下，很小，很锋利，像是正中要害。</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask what I should do,” she said.</p>
<p>“我没问我该不该。”她说。</p>
<p>The heat climbed his neck. He could feel it in his ears, his palms.</p>
<p>热意顺着他的脖子往上爬，耳朵和手心都在发烫。</p>
<p>Outside, a car passed. Somewhere else, someone’s life was continuing on schedule.</p>
<p>窗外有车经过。别的地方，有人的生活正按部就班。</p>
<p>He knew whose place this was. He knew who he was not.</p>
<p>他知道这是谁的地方，也知道自己不是什么人。</p>
<p>Still, he didn’t move.</p>
<p>可他没有动。</p>
<p>She took one step closer. Not touching. Just close enough to change the air.</p>
<p>她向前走了一步，没有碰到他，只是近到足以改变空气。</p>
<p>He answered at last, his voice lower than he intended.</p>
<p>他终于回答了，声音比自己预想的还低。</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“喜欢。”</p></div>
