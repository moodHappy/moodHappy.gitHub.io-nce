<p>新睡衣</p>
<p>“Do you like my new pajamas?” she asked, standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>“你喜欢我的新睡衣吗？”她站在门口问。</p>
<p>They were cotton, light blue, still creased from the package.</p>
<p>那是一套棉质的，浅蓝色，还带着刚拆封的折痕。</p>
<p>The room smelled of detergent and warm water from the shower.</p>
<p>房间里有洗衣液的味道，还有洗完澡留下的热气。</p>
<p>He looked up from his phone, took a second longer than necessary.</p>
<p>他从手机上抬头，刻意慢了半拍。</p>
<p>“They look comfortable,” he said.</p>
<p>“看起来很舒服。”他说。</p>
<p>She walked in, bare feet on the wooden floor, the fabric brushing softly at her knees.</p>
<p>她走进来，光脚踩在木地板上，布料轻轻扫过膝盖。</p>
<p>“I didn’t buy them for looks,” she said. “I bought them so I could sleep.”</p>
<p>“我不是为了好看买的。”她说，“我是为了睡觉。”</p>
<p>He nodded. That made sense. She’d been waking up at three for weeks.</p>
<p>他点点头，这很合理。她已经连续几周凌晨三点醒来。</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the bed and pulled at the sleeve, testing the seam.</p>
<p>她坐在床边，拉了拉袖口，检查走线。</p>
<p>“The old ones scratched my neck,” she said.</p>
<p>“旧的那套磨脖子。”她说。</p>
<p>He reached out, touched the fabric between his fingers. It was thin, clean, cool.</p>
<p>他伸手捏了捏布料，薄，干净，还有点凉。</p>
<p>“Better?” he asked.</p>
<p>“好点了吗？”他问。</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said. “At least tonight.”</p>
<p>“嗯。”她说，“至少今晚是。”</p>
<p>She lay back, turned off the lamp. The room fell into a dull yellow from the streetlight outside.</p>
<p>她躺下，关了灯。窗外路灯的暗黄色漫进来。</p>
<p>In the dark, she said again, quieter this time, “You really think they’re okay?”</p>
<p>黑暗里，她又问了一次，声音低了些：“你真的觉得还行吗？”</p>
<p>“They’re fine,” he said. “If you can sleep, they’re perfect.”</p>
<p>“挺好的。”他说，“你能睡着，就够了。”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer. After a while, her breathing evened out.</p>
<p>她没再说话。过了一会儿，她的呼吸变得平稳。</p>
<p>He stayed awake a little longer, listening to the fabric move when she turned.</p>
<p>他又醒了一会儿，听着她翻身时布料的轻响。</p>
<p>Tomorrow, he thought, he’d tell her they looked good too.</p>
<p>他想，明天再告诉她，其实也很好看。</p></div>
