<p>The phone rang at 2:17 a.m.</p>
<p>Not a ringtone—just a harsh vibration rattling on the nightstand.</p>
<p>Tom groaned and reached out, ready to silence it. Then he saw the screen.</p>
<p>Unknown Caller</p>
<p>He hesitated. No one good ever called at this hour.</p>
<p>“Hello?” His voice was thick with sleep.</p>
<p>For a moment, there was only breathing. Fast. Uneven.</p>
<p>“Tom?” a woman said. “Is this Tom Harris?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Who’s this?”</p>
<p>“I—I found your number on the fridge.” She swallowed hard. “Your mother collapsed.”</p>
<p>Tom sat up instantly. “What? Where are you?”</p>
<p>“At her apartment. She was making tea and just—fell. She’s breathing, but she won’t wake up. I already called an ambulance. They’re on the way.”</p>
<p>His heart slammed against his ribs. “I’m coming.”</p>
<p>He threw on jeans and a jacket, forgetting his shoes until he was already at the door. The streets were empty, traffic lights blinking uselessly at intersections. Every red light felt like an insult.</p>
<p>When he arrived, the ambulance lights painted the building in flashing blue and red. A neighbor stood outside, arms wrapped around herself.</p>
<p>“That’s my son,” she told the paramedic as Tom ran up, breathless.</p>
<p>Inside, his mother lay on the floor, oxygen mask on her face. Her eyes were closed, hair spread out like she’d just laid down for a nap.</p>
<p>“Mom?” he whispered.</p>
<p>She didn’t move.</p>
<p>At the hospital, time dissolved into plastic chairs and bad coffee. A doctor finally came out, mask pulled down around his neck.</p>
<p>“She had a mild stroke,” he said. “You called in time. She’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>Tom nodded, relief crashing over him so hard his knees almost gave out.</p>
<p>Later, sitting by her bed, his phone buzzed again.</p>
<p>Unknown Caller</p>
<p>He answered.</p>
<p>“It’s me,” the woman said softly. “I just wanted to check… is she alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Tom said. “Thank you. You saved her.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. “I almost didn’t call,” she admitted. “I didn’t want to overstep.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you did.”</p>
<p>He ended the call and looked at his mother, now sleeping peacefully.</p>
<p>The room was quiet again.</p>
<p>But this time, the silence felt earned.</p></div>
