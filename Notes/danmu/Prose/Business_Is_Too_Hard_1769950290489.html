    <div class="content"><p>Business Is Too Hard</p>
<p>Lao Chen opened his shop at 7:30 every morning.</p>
<p>The metal shutter screeched as he pulled it up, the same sound for ten years. Inside, the shop smelled of dust, cardboard, and instant noodles. Shelves were full, but nothing moved fast anymore.</p>
<p>He sold phone accessories—cases, cables, screen protectors. Five years ago, people lined up on weekends. Now most of them ordered online.</p>
<p>At 9:00, his first customer came in.</p>
<p>“Do you have this cable?” the man asked, holding up his phone.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Lao Chen said quickly, reaching for the shelf. “Original quality.”</p>
<p>The man checked the price, frowned, and said, “Online it’s cheaper.”</p>
<p>Lao Chen smiled. “You can take it now. No waiting.”</p>
<p>The man nodded politely, then walked out anyway.</p>
<p>By noon, Lao Chen had sold one screen protector for five euros. He wrote it down carefully in his notebook. Rent was 1,200 a month. Electricity kept rising. His son’s school fee was due next week.</p>
<p>Around two o’clock, his wife called.</p>
<p>“How’s business?” she asked.</p>
<p>Lao Chen looked at the empty shop. “Not bad,” he lied.</p>
<p>There was a long pause. “Don’t forget the landlord called again,” she said softly.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>In the afternoon, rain started falling. The street grew quiet. Lao Chen sat on a small plastic stool, scrolling through his phone, watching short videos of people claiming they made money “easily.”</p>
<p>He snorted. Easily.</p>
<p>At six, a young girl rushed in, soaked.</p>
<p>“Can you fix this?” she asked, holding a cracked screen.</p>
<p>Lao Chen examined it. “Yes. Forty euros.”</p>
<p>She hesitated, then nodded. “Okay.”</p>
<p>It took him twenty minutes. When he handed the phone back, the girl smiled. “Thank you. You saved me.”</p>
<p>After she left, Lao Chen counted the day’s total. Not much, but better than zero.</p>
<p>He pulled down the shutter at eight. The streetlights flickered on. He stood there for a moment, key in hand, feeling tired all the way to his bones.</p>
<p>Business was hard. Really hard.</p>
<p>But tomorrow morning, at 7:30, he would pull the shutter up again.</p></div>
