<p>They didn’t talk much that first night.</p>
<p>Mark stood under her window, hands in his jacket pockets, unsure what to do with his face. The alley smelled faintly of rain and old brick. She leaned on the sill, elbows resting casually, as if this were something she did every evening.</p>
<p>“I’m Anna,” she said at last.</p>
<p>“Mark.”</p>
<p>Silence again. Not awkward. Just new.</p>
<p>“You always make tea,” she said. “Around ten thirty.”</p>
<p>Mark blinked. “You noticed that?”</p>
<p>She smiled. “I told you. I noticed.”</p>
<p>That should have made him uncomfortable. Instead, it felt oddly fair.</p>
<p>They talked for ten minutes. About nothing important—her job at a small design studio, his boring work-from-home schedule, how the alley echoed when someone laughed. When she yawned, Mark stepped back.</p>
<p>“Good night,” he said.</p>
<p>“Good night,” she replied. “Same time tomorrow?”</p>
<p>He hesitated for half a second. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The next night, they met in the alley again. This time she came downstairs.</p>
<p>Up close, she wasn’t the calm figure he’d imagined. She fidgeted with her sleeves. He noticed a small scar near her eyebrow.</p>
<p>“You’re quieter than I thought,” she said.</p>
<p>“You’re… louder,” he said, then immediately regretted it.</p>
<p>She laughed. The same sudden laugh he’d heard weeks ago. This time, it didn’t surprise him.</p>
<p>They started walking. No destination. Just around the block, then another. The city felt different at that hour—less like something to watch, more like something to step into.</p>
<p>By the third walk, it became routine.</p>
<p>By the fifth, it became habit.</p>
<p>By the seventh, it became something they didn’t name.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>One evening, it rained hard. Anna showed up with an umbrella too small for two people.</p>
<p>They squeezed under it anyway.</p>
<p>Halfway down the street, Mark’s shoulder was soaked. Anna noticed and pulled him closer without asking.</p>
<p>He froze for a moment.</p>
<p>Then relaxed.</p>
<p>That was the first time he touched her—not dramatically, just his fingers brushing her wrist as they walked. She didn’t pull away.</p>
<p>Later, standing outside her building, neither of them moved to leave.</p>
<p>“This is where things usually get awkward,” Anna said.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to overthink this?”</p>
<p>“Definitely.”</p>
<p>She stepped closer and kissed him before he could say something stupid.</p>
<p>It was brief. Soft. Careful.</p>
<p>When they pulled apart, Mark laughed, breathless. “That felt very… real.”</p>
<p>“Good,” she said. “I was worried you’d try to watch it instead.”</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>They started spending nights together. Not always romantic.</p>
<p>Sometimes they cooked and burned the food. Sometimes they sat on opposite ends of the couch, reading, comfortable in the quiet. Mark learned how Anna took her coffee. Anna learned that Mark talked in his sleep.</p>
<p>One night, Mark stood in Anna’s apartment, looking out at the alley from her window.</p>
<p>The light was on behind him.</p>
<p>“Funny,” he said slowly, “how different it looks from this side.”</p>
<p>Anna wrapped her arms around his waist. “Less mysterious?”</p>
<p>“More honest.”</p>
<p>She rested her head against his back. “Do you miss watching?”</p>
<p>Mark thought about it. About the distance. The safety.</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “I like being here.”</p>
<p>Anna smiled.</p>
<p>She turned off the light.</p>
<p>And for the first time, the alley was just an alley.</p></div>
