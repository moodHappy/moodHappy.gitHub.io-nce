    <div class="content"><p>The Trunk</p>
<p>The suitcase didn’t fit.</p>
<p>Ethan pushed it in, then pulled it out again, breathing a little harder than he wanted to admit. He had measured nothing. He never did. Somehow, he always believed things would work out if he tried enough angles.</p>
<p>The parking lot was half-empty. Yellow lines faded, a shopping cart abandoned near a lamppost. Someone on the third floor was watching TV with the volume too high.</p>
<p>He sat on the edge of the trunk and wiped his forehead with his sleeve.</p>
<p>Inside the suitcase were clothes he didn’t really wear anymore, a pair of shoes still in the box, and a coffee mug wrapped in a towel. The mug had a crack down the side. He should’ve thrown it away years ago. He didn’t.</p>
<p>Ethan rotated the suitcase, pressed down with both hands, then his knee. It went in halfway and got stuck. He laughed under his breath—not because it was funny, but because getting angry felt pointless now.</p>
<p>This was his third hotel in two months.</p>
<p>After the divorce, the apartment had gone to her. Fair enough. She liked the place more. He’d taken what fit in the car and told himself it was temporary. Everything was temporary if you said it confidently enough.</p>
<p>A car pulled up nearby. Someone else unloading bags, moving fast, purposeful. Ethan felt suddenly slow.</p>
<p>He opened the suitcase, took out the shoes, shoved them onto the back seat, then tried again. This time, the trunk closed. Not smoothly—but closed.</p>
<p>He stood there for a moment, keys in hand, listening to the engine tick as it cooled. For a second, he considered going back upstairs, asking for one more night. Just to not drive. Just to sit still.</p>
<p>Instead, he got into the car.</p>
<p>The GPS recalculated. Twenty-seven minutes to the next place.</p>
<p>Ethan pulled out of the lot, the hotel shrinking in the mirror, the suitcase rattling softly behind him, as if reminding him it was still there.</p></div>
