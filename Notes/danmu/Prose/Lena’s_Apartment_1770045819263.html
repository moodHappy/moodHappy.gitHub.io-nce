    <div class="content"><p>Lena’s Apartment</p>
<p>Lena had lived alone for most of her adult life, though she rarely described it that way. She preferred “quiet household” or “no unnecessary explanations.” The truth was simpler: she’d learned early that sharing space didn’t always mean sharing peace.</p>
<p>Her apartment sat above a closed-down tailor shop, four floors up, no elevator. When she first moved in, the stairs annoyed her. Later, she came to appreciate them. By the time someone reached her door, they usually had a reason to be there.</p>
<p>Lena worked at a small accounting firm two tram stops away. The job was steady, unremarkable, and suited her temperament. Numbers behaved. They followed rules. If something didn’t add up, there was always a traceable reason. She liked that. People, on the other hand, had a habit of leaving loose ends.</p>
<p>Most evenings, she cooked for one. Pasta, stir-fry, soup—food that reheated well and didn’t ask questions. She kept plants on the windowsills, not out of sentimentality but because they responded clearly to care. Water them, they lived. Forget, they wilted. Honest transactions.</p>
<p>The week her sister came to stay, Lena adjusted without complaint. She unfolded the sofa bed, cleared a drawer, bought an extra toothbrush without mentioning it. Family, she believed, didn’t need narration.</p>
<p>They didn’t talk much about the renovation, or the marriage behind it. Lena noticed things instead: how her sister paused before answering messages, how she woke too early and lay still, how she folded clothes with unnecessary precision. Lena recognized the signs. She’d worn them herself, years ago.</p>
<p>Back then, she’d been married to a man who filled rooms easily. Too easily. He talked through silences she wanted to keep. When it ended, friends asked why as if there had to be a single moment, a sharp break. Lena never found a sentence that satisfied them. The marriage had simply thinned, day by day, until there was nothing left worth holding.</p>
<p>One evening, while her sister showered, Lena took out the trash and ran into Mark from 3B in the stairwell. He was carrying a toolbox, as usual, sleeves rolled up, hands marked with old scratches.</p>
<p>“Pipe acting up again?” he asked, nodding toward her door.</p>
<p>“Always,” she said. “The building’s older than both of us.”</p>
<p>He smiled at that, the kind of smile that didn’t push for more. Mark had moved in six months earlier, worked maintenance for several properties near the station. He knew buildings the way Lena knew spreadsheets—where things failed, where shortcuts had been taken, which problems would return no matter how often you fixed them.</p>
<p>They talked occasionally. About the weather. About a café near the station that overcharged for bad coffee. About nothing that needed remembering.</p>
<p>That night, Lena’s sister mentioned, offhandedly, that her husband was staying in a cheap hotel near the station until the work was done. Lena filed the information away without comment. She was good at that.</p>
<p>A few days later, Mark knocked on her door to return a misdelivered package. He hesitated, glancing past her shoulder.</p>
<p>“You’ve got company,” he said.</p>
<p>“My sister. Temporarily.”</p>
<p>He nodded, understanding without explanation. “Temporary tends to stretch.”</p>
<p>“So I’ve heard.”</p>
<p>They stood there a moment too long, neither stepping back, neither stepping forward. Then he lifted the toolbox slightly, a gesture halfway between goodbye and something else, and headed downstairs.</p>
<p>After her sister moved out, the apartment felt larger than before. Lena folded the sofa bed away, aired the blankets, returned the drawer to its original purpose. The routines snapped back into place, but not perfectly. Something had shifted—quietly, without permission.</p>
<p>One Saturday, Lena ran into Mark again, this time outside the building. He was locking his bike, jacket slung over the handlebars.</p>
<p>“You ever go to that café?” he asked. “The one by the station.”</p>
<p>She thought of her sister, of passing buses, of hotel doors opening and closing. “Once,” she said. “It’s not great.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I hear,” he said. “Still. Sometimes bad coffee is better than none.”</p>
<p>She considered this. “I suppose it depends what you’re avoiding.”</p>
<p>Mark smiled, slow and unreadable. “Or what you’re waiting for.”</p>
<p>They walked in opposite directions after that. No plans made. No promises implied.</p>
<p>That evening, Lena watered the plants and watched the city dim outside her window. Below, people moved with purpose—toward trains, toward homes, toward places they believed were temporary.</p>
<p>She knew better now. Temporary was just a word people used when they didn’t want to admit something mattered.</p>
<p>Some lives unfolded loudly, demanding attention.
Others, like hers, changed through small accommodations—an extra toothbrush, a folded sofa bed, a conversation in a stairwell that stayed with you longer than it should.</p>
<p>Lena turned off the kitchen light and let the apartment settle around her, exactly as it was.</p></div>
