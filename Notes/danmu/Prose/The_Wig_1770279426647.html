    <div class="content"><p>The Wig</p>
<p>假发</p>
<p>1. The Shop on the Corner</p>
<p>街角的店</p>
<p>The shop was narrow and quiet, pressed between a bakery and a phone repair stand.</p>
<p>这家店很窄，也很安静，被挤在面包店和手机维修摊之间。</p>
<p>A faded plastic head watched the street from the window, wearing brown hair that shone too much in the sun.</p>
<p>橱窗里一只褪色的塑料头望着街道，戴着一顶在阳光下亮得过分的棕色头发。</p>
<p>Lin stopped there three times before she finally walked in.</p>
<p>林在门口停了三次，才真正走进去。</p>
<p>Inside, the air smelled of powder, glue, and something slightly sweet.</p>
<p>屋里有粉末、胶水，还有一点点发甜的味道。</p>
<p>The owner looked up only once, then went back to sewing thin threads into a dark net.</p>
<p>店主只抬头看了一眼，又低头把细线缝进一张深色的网里。</p>
<p>“You want something natural,” he said, as if reading a note she had not written.</p>
<p>“你想要看起来像真的。”他说，像是在读一张她没写出的纸条。</p>
<p>Lin touched her own short hair without answering.</p>
<p>林没有回答，只是摸了摸自己很短的头发。</p>
<p>2. The Reason She Didn’t Say</p>
<p>她没有说出的原因</p>
<p>She had cut it two weeks ago in a bathroom with weak yellow light.</p>
<p>两周前，她在一间灯光发黄的浴室里把头发剪掉了。</p>
<p>The scissors were old and pulled at the strands instead of slicing them clean.</p>
<p>剪刀很旧，拉扯着发丝，而不是干脆地切断。</p>
<p>Hair fell into the sink, the floor, and the sleeve of her shirt.</p>
<p>头发落在水池里、地上，还有她的袖口里。</p>
<p>She did not cry then.</p>
<p>那时她没有哭。</p>
<p>People always expected tears at the wrong moment.</p>
<p>人们总是在错误的时刻期待眼泪。</p>
<p>The crying came later, in a supermarket, when she reached back to tie a ponytail that no longer existed.</p>
<p>真正的哭是在后来，在超市里，她下意识把手伸到脑后，想扎一个已经不存在的马尾。</p>
<p>3. Trying It On</p>
<p>试戴</p>
<p>The owner placed the wig on her head with slow, careful hands.</p>
<p>店主用缓慢而小心的手把假发放到她头上。</p>
<p>The hair was softer than she expected.</p>
<p>头发比她想的要柔软。</p>
<p>It brushed her neck in a way that felt almost familiar.</p>
<p>它擦过她的脖子，带来一种几乎熟悉的感觉。</p>
<p>She looked into the mirror but focused on the space behind her reflection.</p>
<p>她看向镜子，却把目光放在倒影后面的空处。</p>
<p>“For work?” the owner asked.</p>
<p>“上班用？”店主问。</p>
<p>“For seeing people,” she said.</p>
<p>“见人用。”她说。</p>
<p>He nodded, as if that explained everything.</p>
<p>他点了点头，好像这已经足够解释一切。</p>
<p>4. Walking Back Outside</p>
<p>走回街上</p>
<p>When she stepped out, the wind lifted the new hair slightly.</p>
<p>她走出门时，风把新的头发轻轻掀起一点。</p>
<p>No one stopped walking.</p>
<p>没有人停下脚步。</p>
<p>No one looked twice.</p>
<p>也没有人多看一眼。</p>
<p>She passed the bakery window and saw herself between rows of bright bread.</p>
<p>她经过面包店的橱窗，在一排排亮着光的面包之间看见自己。</p>
<p>For a moment, she tried to remember the weight of her real hair.</p>
<p>有一瞬间，她试着回想自己原来头发的重量。</p>
<p>The memory felt distant, like a room she had already moved out of.</p>
<p>那记忆很远，像一间她已经搬走的房间。</p>
<p>She kept walking, one hand lightly holding the side of the wig, not to hide it, only to feel that it was still there.</p>
<p>她继续往前走，一只手轻轻扶着假发的边缘，不是为了遮掩，只是想确认它还在。</p></div>
