<p>葬礼</p>
<p>She lay in a simple coffin, the room smelling faintly of lilies and wax.</p>
<p>她躺在一个简单的棺材里，房间里弥漫着淡淡的百合花和蜡的气味。</p>
<p>The church was nearly empty, just a handful of colleagues and distant friends.</p>
<p>教堂几乎空无一人，只有几个同事和不太熟的朋友。</p>
<p>No one spoke her name aloud; it hovered silently in the air.</p>
<p>没有人出声叫她的名字；它静静地悬在空气里。</p>
<p>A priest read from a book, his voice steady but hollow.</p>
<p>神父从书中朗读，他的声音平稳却空洞。</p>
<p>She had planned her own service with quiet precision, leaving instructions on what to play and what to say.</p>
<p>她早已悄悄规划好了自己的葬礼，留下了播放什么、说什么的指示。</p>
<p>Her hair, once a defiant statement, was gone, replaced by the smooth curve of her scalp.</p>
<p>她的头发，曾经的倔强宣言，如今已经不在，只剩光滑的头皮曲线。</p>
<p>Friends draped scarves over their shoulders, trying to honor her memory without invading it.</p>
<p>朋友们把围巾披在肩上，试图纪念她，却不去打扰她。</p>
<p>Someone whispered a story about her last days, careful, almost reverent.</p>
<p>有人低声讲起她最后的日子，小心翼翼，几乎带着敬意。</p>
<p>The casket closed with a soft thud, final and absolute.</p>
<p>棺材轻轻合上，声音柔和，却带着最终的绝对感。</p>
<p>Outside, the sky was gray, the wind carrying a chill that seemed to mirror the room inside.</p>
<p>外面，天空灰沉，风带着寒意，仿佛映照着屋内的氛围。</p>
<p>The earth swallowed her quietly, methodically, without ceremony beyond necessity.</p>
<p>大地默默、谨慎地吞没了她，没有超出必要的仪式。</p>
<p>No flowers could reclaim what had been lost.</p>
<p>没有花能够挽回已经失去的东西。</p>
<p>And yet, in the stillness, there was a strange kind of order, a closure she had always craved.</p>
<p>然而，在寂静中，有一种奇怪的秩序感，这是她一直渴望的结局。</p>
<p>Her absence was absolute, but so was the control she had held until the very end.</p>
<p>她的离去是彻底的，但她在最后依然掌握着一切。</p></div>
