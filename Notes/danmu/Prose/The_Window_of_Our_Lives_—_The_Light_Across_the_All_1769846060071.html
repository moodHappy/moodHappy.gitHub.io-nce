<p>By the time Mark was seventy-three, they had lived decades together, but memory has a way of preserving both warmth and guilt.</p>
<p>Anna’s hair had turned silver, her laugh quieter but still familiar. Mark moved a little slower, though his eyes still found her first in a room. They spent their days in the apartment near the alley, the window light still catching the late afternoon perfectly.</p>
<p>One evening, while rummaging through old letters and photographs, Mark accidentally revealed something he had kept secret for decades: three brief romances during his years away on work, the so-called “temporary” stints that Anna had never known about.</p>
<p>Anna sat quietly, her hands gripping the armrests of her chair. The air between them thickened, heavier than any storm they had weathered.</p>
<p>“You… you had them?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“I… I never meant—” Mark started, shame cracking his voice.</p>
<p>She held up a hand. “I know what you never meant. But still…”</p>
<p>Her own past, she realized, mirrored his more closely than she had admitted even to herself. There had been a man during a brief trip abroad, a fleeting moment of weakness, nothing more than what the city allows when loneliness presses too hard. She had buried it deep, thinking it was forgiven by time, or irrelevant in the face of decades together.</p>
<p>The room seemed to shrink. Silence stretched. And then, slowly, they began talking. Not accusing, not defending, just telling—truths long left in shadows.</p>
<p>It was painful. It was necessary. It was human.</p>
<p>By the time Mark was eighty-two, they had learned something neither had fully understood when they were young: love is not about perfection. It is about staying, even after the secrets, even after the distance, even after the missteps that life forces upon you.</p>
<p>They walked slowly in the alley again, hands entwined, leaning on canes, laughing softly at the memory of a yellow window that had once started it all.</p>
<p>The alley, the city, the years—they had taken and given much. But here, together, in their twilight, Mark and Anna held a quiet, honest love. Messy. Imperfect. Entirely theirs.</p>
<p>And for the first time, the window—their window—was not just a beginning, nor a boundary, nor a secret. It was a witness.</p></div>
