<p>It happened in the elevator.</p>
<p>Jason was already late, juggling his phone, his coffee, and his dignity. He slipped into the elevator just as the doors were closing and sighed in relief.</p>
<p>Only one other person was inside—a woman standing in the corner, earbuds in, staring at the numbers above the door.</p>
<p>The elevator started moving.</p>
<p>Jason’s phone buzzed. A message from his friend popped up:</p>
<p>Did you fart again at work?</p>
<p>Jason snorted before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>The sound echoed. Loud. Sharp.</p>
<p>The woman’s head tilted slightly.</p>
<p>Jason cleared his throat. “Uh… allergies.”</p>
<p>She didn’t respond.</p>
<p>To make things worse, his stomach chose that exact moment to betray him.</p>
<p>A noise. Low. Unmistakable.</p>
<p>Time froze.</p>
<p>The elevator hummed. The numbers climbed painfully slowly.</p>
<p>The woman finally pulled out one earbud and looked at him. Not angry. Just curious.</p>
<p>“Long morning?” she asked.</p>
<p>Jason’s face burned. “You have no idea.”</p>
<p>She smiled. The doors opened.</p>
<p>She stepped out, paused, and said, “For what it’s worth, I thought it was my floor.”</p>
<p>Then she was gone.</p>
<p>Jason stayed inside for another ten seconds, staring at the closing doors, seriously considering changing jobs.</p></div>
