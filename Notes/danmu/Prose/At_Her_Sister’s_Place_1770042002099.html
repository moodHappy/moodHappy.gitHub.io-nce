<p>She told people she was staying with her sister because it was closer to work.
That was true, technically. The bus ride was shorter. The mornings were quieter. There was always hot water.</p>
<p>But the real reason was harder to phrase without sounding dramatic, so she didn’t try.</p>
<p>Her sister’s apartment sat on the fourth floor of an old building with uneven stairs. Every step creaked differently, as if the place remembered who was climbing. Inside, the rooms were narrow but bright. Plants crowded the windowsills, leaves brushing the glass like they were listening in. Her sister had always liked things alive.</p>
<p>“Make yourself at home,” her sister said on the first night, handing her a towel that smelled of lemon detergent. “It’s just for a few days, right?”</p>
<p>“Just a few,” she replied, already knowing that meant nothing.</p>
<p>They fell into a routine quickly. Breakfast at the small kitchen table. Her sister scrolling through news on her phone, muttering about politics. She drank her coffee slowly, black, watching steam rise and vanish. In the evenings, they cooked simple meals—pasta, soup, things that didn’t require decisions. Sometimes they ate together. Sometimes her sister took a call and paced the living room, leaving her alone with the hum of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>At night, she slept on the sofa bed. It was firm, unfamiliar. She lay awake longer than she expected, listening to the building breathe—pipes knocking, a neighbor’s footsteps, a distant train. She checked her phone more often than she meant to. Messages came in practical bursts: photos of tiles, questions about paint colors, a reminder about an appointment next week.</p>
<p>She replied carefully. Too many words felt needy. Too few felt cold. She settled on efficiency.</p>
<p>During the day, she noticed things she hadn’t had time to notice before. The way her sister hummed when she cleaned. The way sunlight shifted across the floor at noon. How silence could feel full instead of empty, if you let it.</p>
<p>One afternoon, while folding laundry, she found herself holding one of his shirts. It must have slipped into her bag without thinking. She pressed it flat, smoothing a wrinkle that didn’t matter. For a moment, she considered wearing it to sleep, then folded it neatly and placed it at the bottom of the drawer instead.</p>
<p>Her sister didn’t ask questions, not directly. But once, while chopping onions, she said, “You know, staying somewhere else can make things clearer. Or messier. Usually one of the two.”</p>
<p>“Which one did it do for you?” she asked.</p>
<p>Her sister smiled without looking up. “Both. Depends on the day.”</p>
<p>They laughed, lightly, as if it were a joke.</p>
<p>On the third night, she dreamed of elevators—doors opening and closing, always missing the timing by a second. She woke before dawn, heart beating faster than it should have. She sat up and checked her phone. Nothing new. Just the dim reflection of her own face in the screen.</p>
<p>She wondered what he was doing at that moment. Not in a dramatic way. Just idle curiosity, like wondering about the weather in a city you used to live in.</p>
<p>Later that week, her sister mentioned a cheap hotel near the station, complaining about tourists clogging the sidewalk lately. She nodded, noncommittal, and changed the subject.</p>
<p>When the renovation finally ended, she packed her things slowly. Her sister leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed.</p>
<p>“You can stay longer,” she said. “You know that.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>They hugged—longer than usual, not quite long enough.</p>
<p>On the way home, she passed the station and caught sight of the hotel entrance from the bus window. Just a building. Glass doors, people coming and going. She felt nothing dramatic. No pull, no ache. Just a faint awareness, like recognizing a street name without remembering why it mattered.</p>
<p>That evening, back in the apartment, everything was cleaner, brighter. New tiles, fresh paint. He talked about deadlines and meetings. She listened, nodded, asked the right questions.</p>
<p>Later, alone in the bathroom, she examined her face in the mirror. The same face. Slightly tired. Slightly older. Still hers.</p>
<p>Somewhere in her sister’s apartment, a sofa bed folded back into a couch. Plants reached toward the window. Life continued, parallel and intact.</p>
<p>She brushed her teeth, turned off the light, and went to bed.</p>
<p>Some things, she understood now, didn’t announce themselves when they changed.
They simply became part of the background—quiet, persistent, and easy to ignore if you chose to.</p></div>
