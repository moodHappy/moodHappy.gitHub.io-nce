    So, I was walking home from work one day when I saw this <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(255, 59, 48);" data-wh-processed="true">weird</span> thing in the sky. It was like a big silver ball, just <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(175, 82, 222);" data-wh-processed="true">floating</span> there. I thought it was a <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(255, 59, 48);" data-wh-processed="true">balloon</span> or something, but then it started moving, really fast. It zoomed down and landed right in front of me. I was pretty <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(255, 59, 48);" data-wh-processed="true">scared</span>, but then a door opened and this <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(0, 122, 255);" data-wh-processed="true">robot</span> came out. It was talking to me in perfect English, which was really <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(255, 59, 48);" data-wh-processed="true">weird</span>. It told me it was from the future and had come to take me on a trip. I know it sounds crazy, but I got in and we flew off into space. We saw some amazing things, like stars and planets up close. It was incredible. Then we came back and the <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(0, 122, 255);">robot</span> just disappeared. <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(175, 82, 222);">I'm</span> still trying to figure out if it was all just a <span class="wh-highlighted" style="color: rgb(0, 122, 255);">dream</span> or not.
