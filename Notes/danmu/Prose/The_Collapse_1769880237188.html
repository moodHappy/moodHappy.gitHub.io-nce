<p>The siren went off at 9:17 a.m.</p>
<p>At first, people thought it was a drill. The mine had drills all the time—safety talks, inspections, paperwork that never reached the tunnels below. The families in the nearby town didn’t panic. Not yet.</p>
<p>Then the siren didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Underground, the shift had just changed. Two hundred men were spread across different levels, some joking, some half-asleep, some already thinking about lunch. No one heard the crack at first. It was too deep, too old, like the mountain clearing its throat.</p>
<p>The second sound was louder.</p>
<p>A roar rushed through the tunnels. Lights went out. The air filled with dust so thick it felt solid. Radios screamed once and then went dead.</p>
<p>Above ground, the mine manager stood frozen, helmet still clean, staring at the monitoring screen. One line blinked red. Then another. Then all of them.</p>
<p>By noon, the entrance was sealed by rubble. Rescue teams arrived, faces gray before they even went down. They worked for hours, then days, drilling, listening, calling names into the dark.</p>
<p>No one answered.</p>
<p>The town gathered at the gate. Wives held phones that no longer rang. Children asked why their fathers were late. Someone brought flowers too early and didn’t know where to put them.</p>
<p>On the third day, the announcement came.</p>
<p>“Two hundred confirmed fatalities.”</p>
<p>The sentence was short. Efficient. It fit neatly into a press release.</p>
<p>The mine closed a week later. The company promised investigations, compensation, “lessons learned.” New fences went up. Warning signs were replaced.</p>
<p>The mountain stayed.</p>
<p>Months passed. Grass grew over the entrance. Trucks stopped coming. The town became quieter, poorer, older.</p>
<p>Sometimes, at night, people swore they could hear something beneath the ground—
not voices, not shouting—
just a low, endless pressure, as if the earth itself was remembering the weight of what it had taken.</p></div>
