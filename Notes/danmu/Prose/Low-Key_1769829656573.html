<p>Everyone at the office thought Mark was boring.</p>
<p>He arrived at 8:57 every morning, left at 5:30 sharp, and never stayed late.
No overtime. No speeches. No opinions in meetings unless someone asked him directly.</p>
<p>When people complained about work, Mark nodded.
When people bragged, Mark smiled and stayed quiet.</p>
<p>“Does he even care?” someone once whispered.</p>
<p>Mark cared.
He just didn’t advertise it.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>One Thursday afternoon, the system crashed.</p>
<p>Emails froze. Files vanished. The server light blinked red like a warning sign in a movie.</p>
<p>Panic spread fast.</p>
<p>“Who touched the database?”
“Did we lose everything?”
“Call IT—now!”</p>
<p>Phones rang. Voices rose.</p>
<p>Mark didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>He walked to his desk, opened his laptop, and plugged in a small black USB drive.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the files reappeared.</p>
<p>Emails refreshed. The red light turned green.</p>
<p>Silence filled the room.</p>
<p>“What… just happened?” the manager asked.</p>
<p>Mark looked up.
“Backup,” he said. “I made one last week. Just in case.”</p>
<p>“That saved us hours,” the manager said. “Why didn’t you tell anyone?”</p>
<p>Mark shrugged.
“No one asked.”</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Later that day, someone said,
“Man, you should show off more.”</p>
<p>Mark packed his bag.
“Nah,” he said. “Low-key works fine.”</p>
<p>He stepped outside into the evening air, put on his headphones, and walked home like it was just another day.</p>
<p>And for him, it was.</p></div>
