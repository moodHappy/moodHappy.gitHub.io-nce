<p>第十一章：高塔上的视线</p>
<p>The top floor of the Kurosaki Heavy Industries headquarters. This place overlooked the entire Tokyo nightscape, like the throne of a god.</p>
<p>黑崎重工总部顶层。这里俯瞰着整个东京的夜景，像神的王座。</p>
<p>Kurosaki Soichiro, the 70-year-old business tycoon, sat behind a massive mahogany desk. He wore white gloves, his face expressionless as he flipped through a stack of high-definition photos.</p>
<p>70岁的商业巨头黑崎宗一郎坐在巨大的红木办公桌后。他戴着白手套，面无表情地翻看着一叠高清照片。</p>
<p>The photos captured the moment Chen Mo left "The Nest." His messy collar, his hollow footsteps, and the dazzling, ambiguous red marks on his neck were clearly visible under the telephoto lens.</p>
<p>照片上是陈默离开“巢穴”的瞬间。他凌乱的领口，虚浮的脚步，还有脖颈上那刺眼、暧昧的红痕，在长焦镜头下清晰可见。</p>
<p>"Sir, do we need to 'clean up' this person?" A secretary in a black suit stood in the shadows, asking in a low voice.</p>
<p>“社长，需要‘清理’掉这个人吗？”阴影里，一个黑西装秘书低声询问。</p>
<p>Kurosaki picked up a photo with tweezers—as if touching it directly would dirty his hands—and sneered with extreme contempt.</p>
<p>黑崎用镊子夹起一张照片——仿佛直接用手触碰会脏了他的手——发出一声极度轻蔑的冷笑。</p>
<p>"A stray dog looking for food in a trash can. Why bother getting blood on our hands?" He threw the photo into the shredder. "That woman has been restless lately. It's better to let her find a vent than to have her staring at my accounts all day. Let her play. Once she gets tired of playing, she will naturally come back to the cage."</p>
<p>“一条在垃圾桶里找食吃的野狗罢了，何必脏了手？”他把照片丢进碎纸机。“那个女人最近躁动得很，让她找个排泄口，总比让她整天盯着我的账目好。让她玩。玩腻了，她自然会回笼子里。”</p>
<p>"Yes. But... do we need to monitor him?"</p>
<p>“是。但是……需要监控他吗？”</p>
<p>"No need. A corporate slave who works for a monthly salary of 400,000 yen doesn't have the guts to bite. Just make sure she doesn't give him too much money."</p>
<p>“不必。一个拿四十万日元月薪的社畜，没那个胆子咬人。只要盯着她别给他太多钱就行。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko's bet was right. Arrogance was Kurosaki's only weakness. In his eyes, a man's worth is measured by power. Chen Mo, who had no power, was not even qualified to be an enemy.</p>
<p>美悦子赌赢了。傲慢是黑崎唯一的弱点。在他眼里，男人的价值是由权力衡量的。毫无权力的陈默，连成为敌人的资格都没有。</p></div>
