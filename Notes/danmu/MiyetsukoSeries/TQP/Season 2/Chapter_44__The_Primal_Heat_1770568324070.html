<p>第四十四章：原始的热度</p>
<p>The promise hung in the damp air. It calmed her.</p>
<p>那个承诺悬在潮湿的空气中。让她平静了下来。</p>
<p>"My ribs hurt," she whispered, the Queen fading, the woman returning. "The vest was too tight."</p>
<p>“我的肋骨疼，”她低语，女王褪去，女人回归。“背心太紧了。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo knelt down. He inspected the angry red marks under her breasts. The skin was tender, swollen.</p>
<p>陈默跪下来。他检查她乳房下方的愤怒红痕。皮肤很嫩，肿胀着。</p>
<p>"Lie down," he pointed to the sleeping bag he had spread on the floor.</p>
<p>“躺下，”他指了指铺在地上的睡袋。</p>
<p>She lay back. The hard floor was unforgiving, but she didn't care.</p>
<p>她躺下。坚硬的地板毫不留情，但她不在乎。</p>
<p>Chen Mo poured some oil—gun oil, the only lubricant they had—into his palms and rubbed them together to warm it.</p>
<p>陈默倒了一些油——枪油，他们唯一的润滑剂——在掌心，搓热。</p>
<p>He began to massage her ribs.</p>
<p>他开始按摩她的肋骨。</p>
<p>His thumbs dug into the intercostal muscles, working out the knots. It hurt, but it was a good pain. A releasing pain.</p>
<p>他的拇指按进肋间肌，揉开那些结节。很疼，但是那种舒服的疼。释放的疼。</p>
<p>"Ah..." she arched her back, her breasts swaying gently with the movement. "Lower... please."</p>
<p>“啊……”她弓起背，乳房随着动作轻轻晃动。“再低点……求你。”</p>
<p>His hands slid down to her waist, then to her hips, kneading the sore muscles that had been battered by the car seat. The smell of gun oil mixed with her natural scent—musk and rain—creating an intoxicating perfume.</p>
<p>他的手滑向她的腰，然后是臀部，揉捏着被车座撞击酸痛的肌肉。枪油的味道混合着她天然的体香——麝香和雨水——制造出一种令人陶醉的香气。</p>
<p>"You are cold," Chen Mo noticed goosebumps on her thighs.</p>
<p>“你冷，”陈默注意到她大腿上的鸡皮疙瘩。</p>
<p>"Then warm me," she opened her legs slightly. It wasn't a demand this time. It was an invitation to shelter.</p>
<p>“那就温暖我，”她微微张开腿。这次不是命令。是对庇护所的邀请。</p>
<p>Chen Mo lay down beside her, pulling her into his arms. His body heat radiated through her, chasing away the chill of the jungle and the memory of the prison cell.</p>
<p>陈默躺在她身边，把她拉进怀里。他的体温辐射进她的身体，驱散了丛林的寒冷和牢房的记忆。</p>
<p>He didn't take her. Not tonight. Tonight was about survival.</p>
<p>他没有占有她。今晚不行。今晚是为了生存。</p>
<p>He just held her. His hand rested on her breast, feeling her heartbeat slow down. Her leg threw over his hip, anchoring herself to him.</p>
<p>他只是抱着她。他的手停在她胸口，感受着她的心跳慢下来。她的腿搭在他的胯骨上，把自己锚定在他身上。</p>
<p>In the darkness of the bunker, surrounded by enemies, they were two broken pieces that fit perfectly together.</p>
<p>在地堡的黑暗中，被敌人包围，他们是两块破碎的拼图，完美地契合在一起。</p>
<p>"We kill him, Chen," she murmured into his chest, her eyes closing. "We kill the nightmare."</p>
<p>“我们杀了他，陈，”她在他的胸口呢喃，眼睛闭上。“我们杀掉那个噩梦。”</p>
<p>"We will," Chen Mo kissed her forehead. "Sleep now, Queen. Tomorrow, we hunt."</p>
<p>“会的，”陈默吻了吻她的额头。“睡吧，女王。明天，我们去狩猎。”</p></div>
