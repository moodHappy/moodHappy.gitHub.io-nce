<p>第四十三章：牢房里的幽灵</p>
<p>Chen Mo wet a cloth with water from a canteen and began to wipe the soot and dried sweat from her back. The water was cold. She shivered, her skin bumping.</p>
<p>陈默用水壶里的水沾湿一块布，开始擦拭她背上的烟灰和干汗。水很冷。她打了个寒颤，皮肤起了鸡皮疙瘩。</p>
<p>"The dream..." she started, her voice echoing in the concrete box. "It wasn't just a memory, Chen."</p>
<p>“那个梦……”她开口了，声音在混凝土盒子里回荡。“那不仅仅是回忆，陈。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo stopped wiping. His hand rested on her bruised shoulder.</p>
<p>陈默停止了擦拭。他的手停在她淤青的肩膀上。</p>
<p>"I saw him," she turned around, ignoring her nakedness, her eyes locking onto his. "Not the Kurosaki from seven years ago. The Kurosaki of now. In his cell."</p>
<p>“我看见他了，”她转过身，无视自己的赤裸，眼神锁住他的。“不是七年前的黑崎。是现在的黑崎。在他的牢房里。”</p>
<p>"He is smiling, Chen. He is sitting on his bunk, smiling at the wall. Because he knows."</p>
<p>“他在笑，陈。他坐在铺位上，对着墙笑。因为他知道。”</p>
<p>"Knows what?"</p>
<p>“知道什么？”</p>
<p>"He knows he's not dead. He knows that as long as he breathes, even in a hole in Tokyo, he owns a piece of me. That night... he planted a seed of fear that won't die until the host dies."</p>
<p>“他知道他没死。他知道只要他还呼吸，哪怕是在东京的一个洞里，他就依然占有我的一部分。那一夜……他种下了一颗恐惧的种子，宿主不死，种子不灭。”</p>
<p>She grabbed Chen Mo's hand and placed it on her throat.</p>
<p>她抓起陈默的手，按在自己的喉咙上。</p>
<p>"I need to cut it out. I need to go back."</p>
<p>“我得把它切除。我得回去。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo looked at her. He understood. This wasn't about strategy. It wasn't about survival. It was an exorcism.</p>
<p>陈默看着她。他懂了。这无关战略。无关生存。这是一场驱魔。</p>
<p>"Tokyo Maximum Security Prison," Chen Mo whispered. "It's a fortress. Breaking in is suicide."</p>
<p>“东京最高安全监狱，”陈默低语。“那是一座堡垒。闯进去就是自杀。”</p>
<p>"We don't break in," a cold smile touched her lips, contrasting with the vulnerability of her naked body. "We get invited. Or we become ghosts."</p>
<p>“我们不硬闯，”一抹冷笑浮上她的嘴唇，与她赤裸身体的脆弱形成对比。“我们要被邀请进去。或者变成幽灵进去。”</p>
<p>"Not now," Chen Mo brushed a strand of wet hair from her face. "Now, we survive Rio. But I promise you... we will send him to hell. Personally."</p>
<p>“不是现在，”陈默拨开她脸上的一缕湿发。“现在，我们得在里约活下去。但我向你保证……我们会送他下地狱。亲手送。”</p></div>
