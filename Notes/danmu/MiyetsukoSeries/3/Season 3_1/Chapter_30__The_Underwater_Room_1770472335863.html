<p>第三十章：水下房间</p>
<p>They paid cash to a faceless receptionist behind a small window and stumbled into the room.</p>
<p>他们隔着小窗口付了现金给一个看不见脸的前台，跌跌撞撞地进了房间。</p>
<p>It was a themed room. "Underwater World." The walls were painted blue with crudely drawn fish. The bed was round, covered in cheap satin sheets. The whole room smelled of cheap air freshener and stale sex.</p>
<p>这是一个主题房。“水下世界”。墙壁漆成蓝色，上面画着粗糙的鱼。床是圆的，铺着廉价的缎面床单。整个房间弥漫着廉价空气清新剂和陈旧的性爱气味。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko leaned against the door, locking it. Her chest was heaving heavily. Water dripped from her hair onto the floor.</p>
<p>美悦子靠在门上，反锁了门。她的胸口剧烈起伏。水珠顺着她的头发滴在地板上。</p>
<p>She looked at Chen Mo. Their eyes met in the dim blue light.</p>
<p>她看着陈默。他们的目光在昏暗的蓝光中相遇。</p>
<p>Surviving disaster is the strongest aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>劫后余生是最强的催情剂。</p>
<p>The fear of death, the excitement of violence, the cold of the rain—it all turned into a raw, desperate need for heat and connection.</p>
<p>死亡的恐惧，暴力的兴奋，雨水的寒冷——这一切都转化成了对热量和连接的原始、绝望的需求。</p>
<p>"You saved me," she whispered, her voice trembling slightly, not from fear, but from something else.</p>
<p>“你救了我，”她低声说，声音微微颤抖，不是因为恐惧，而是因为别的。</p>
<p>"You saved yourself. That kick was brutal," Chen Mo walked towards her.</p>
<p>“你救了你自己。那一脚真狠，”陈默走向她。</p>
<p>He reached out and touched her wet shirt. His fingers brushed over the hardened points underneath.</p>
<p>他伸出手，触碰她湿透的衬衫。指尖划过下面硬挺的点。</p>
<p>"I'm cold, Chen Mo. Freeze-to-death cold." She looked at him, her eyes full of water, like a siren just fishing out of the sea. "Warm me up. Now."</p>
<p>“我好冷，陈默。冷得要死了。”她看着他，眼里全是水汽，像刚从海里捞出来的塞壬女妖。“给我取暖。现在。”</p>
<p>She didn't wait for him to act. She grabbed the front of her wet shirt and ripped it open. Buttons bounced on the floor.</p>
<p>她没等他行动。她抓住自己湿衬衫的前襟，猛地撕开了。扣子在地板上乱蹦。</p>
<p>That magnificent, defiant whiteness jumped out into the blue light, covered in raindrops and sweat, exuding steaming heat in the cold room.</p>
<p>那宏伟、桀骜不驯的雪白在蓝光中跳脱出来，上面覆盖着雨水和汗水，在寒冷的房间里散发着蒸腾的热气。</p>
<p>It wasn't a gentle invitation. It was a demand for survival.</p>
<p>这不是温柔的邀请。这是为了生存的索取。</p></div>
