<p>第四十九章：赤裸的黎明</p>
<p>Hours later. Or maybe minutes. Time had lost its meaning.</p>
<p>几小时后。或者几分钟。时间失去了意义。</p>
<p>The eastern horizon began to turn a bruised purple. The first light of dawn crept over the Pacific.</p>
<p>东方的地平线开始变成淤青般的紫色。黎明的第一缕光爬过了太平洋。</p>
<p>Chen Mo lay on the leather seat, exhausted. Miyetsuko lay curled up on the floor of the boat, using his jacket as a blanket.</p>
<p>陈默精疲力竭地躺在皮座椅上。美悦子蜷缩在船的地板上，把他的外套当毯子盖。</p>
<p>The sunlight hit her.</p>
<p>阳光打在她身上。</p>
<p>It was a cruel, beautiful sight. Her naked body was covered in marks—bruises from the fight, red welts from the tight leather suit, and darker hickeys from Chen Mo. She looked like a masterpiece painting that had been slashed by a vandal.</p>
<p>那是残酷而美丽的一幕。她赤裸的身体上布满了痕迹——打斗留下的淤青，紧身皮衣勒出的红印，还有陈默留下的深色吻痕。她看起来像一幅被暴徒划破的杰作名画。</p>
<p>But she was sleeping peacefully. Her chest rose and fell rhythmically, that magnificent weight shifting gently with gravity.</p>
<p>但她睡得很安详。胸口有节奏地起伏，那宏伟的重量随着重力轻轻移动。</p>
<p>Chen Mo checked the fuel gauge. 15%.</p>
<p>陈默检查了油量表。15%。</p>
<p>"Wake up," he nudged her gently with his foot. "We need to land before the Coast Guard wakes up."</p>
<p>“醒醒，”他用脚轻轻碰了碰她。“我们得在海岸警卫队醒来之前靠岸。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko opened one eye. It was bloodshot but clear.</p>
<p>美悦子睁开一只眼。眼里布满血丝，但很清醒。</p>
<p>"Where are we?" She sat up, the jacket sliding off. She didn't bother to cover herself. In this vast ocean, shame was a luxury they left back in Tokyo.</p>
<p>“我们在哪？”她坐起来，外套滑落。她没费心去遮掩。在这片广阔的海洋上，羞耻心是他们留在东京的奢侈品。</p>
<p>"Drifted south. Chiba Prefecture. Kisarazu coast," Chen Mo pointed to the distant coastline. "Industrial zone. Lots of noise, lots of smoke. Easy to hide."</p>
<p>“向南漂了。千叶县。木更津海岸，”陈默指着远处的海岸线。“工业区。噪音大，烟雾多。容易藏身。”</p>
<p>"My clothes are ruined," she kicked the pile of wet leather. "I can't walk into a city naked with a gun holster."</p>
<p>“我的衣服毁了，”她踢了踢那一堆湿皮衣。“我不能光着身子、戴着枪套走进城市。”</p>
<p>"We'll find something," Chen Mo started the engine. "Even a trash bag looks like haute couture on you."</p>
<p>“我们会找到穿的，”陈默启动引擎。“哪怕是个垃圾袋，穿在你身上也像高定。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko laughed, a raspy morning sound. She stood up, stretching her limbs. The sunlight illuminated the curve of her waist and the shadow of her hips.</p>
<p>美悦子笑了，那是沙哑的清晨笑声。她站起来，伸展四肢。阳光照亮了她腰肢的曲线和臀部的阴影。</p>
<p>"Flattery won't get you a second round, Chen. I'm hungry. I want steak."</p>
<p>“奉承话换不来第二回合，陈。我饿了。我想吃牛排。”</p></div>
