<p>第六十一章：低语茶室</p>
<p>Ginza. "Kitsune" Private Tea House.</p>
<p>银座。“狐”私人茶室。</p>
<p>The room was small, smelling of matcha and cedar. Outside, the rain drummed rhythmically on the bamboo roof.</p>
<p>房间很小，弥漫着抹茶和杉木的味道。窗外，雨点有节奏地敲打着竹制屋顶。</p>
<p>Dr. Sato, the chief cardiologist of the Tokyo Detention House, sat on the tatami mat. He was sweating, despite the air conditioning.</p>
<p>佐藤医生，东京拘留所的首席心脏科医生，跪坐在榻榻米上。尽管开着空调，他还是在冒汗。</p>
<p>Across from him sat Miyetsuko. She wore a midnight-blue kimono, conservative yet impeccably expensive. She poured tea with the grace of a practiced hostess.</p>
<p>坐在他对面的是美悦子。她穿着一件午夜蓝的和服，保守却昂贵得无懈可击。她以熟练女主人的优雅倒着茶。</p>
<p>"Dr. Sato," she slid the cup across the table. "I hear my husband's heart is... failing."</p>
<p>“佐藤医生，”她把茶杯推过桌面。“听说我丈夫的心脏……在衰竭。”</p>
<p>"Stress, Mrs. Kurosaki," Sato wiped his forehead. "The trial... the confinement... it is taking a toll."</p>
<p>“压力，黑崎夫人，”佐藤擦了擦额头。“审判……监禁……这对他打击很大。”</p>
<p>"Mishima wants him dead before the trial," she took a sip of her tea. Her eyes over the rim of the cup were like frozen lakes. "He will offer you money to overdose him. Or switch his pills."</p>
<p>“三岛想让他在审判前死，”她抿了一口茶。杯沿上方的眼睛像冰封的湖面。“他会给你钱让你给他注射过量药物。或者换掉他的药丸。”</p>
<p>Sato flinched. He had already received that call.</p>
<p>佐藤瑟缩了一下。他确实已经接到了那个电话。</p>
<p>"I... I took an oath..."</p>
<p>“我……我发过誓……”</p>
<p>"Oaths don't pay gambling debts, Doctor," Chen Mo stepped out from the shadows of the sliding door. He placed a thick envelope on the table. It wasn't money. It was photos. Photos of Sato at an illegal underground casino run by the Yakuza.</p>
<p>“誓言还不了赌债，医生，”陈默从拉门后的阴影里走出来。他把一个厚信封放在桌上。不是钱。是照片。佐藤在极道运行的地下赌场里的照片。</p>
<p>"We don't want you to kill him," Miyetsuko smiled gently. She reached into her obi sash and pulled out a small, white capsule. It looked exactly like Kurosaki's heart medication. "We want you to save him."</p>
<p>“我们要你别杀他，”美悦子温柔地笑了。她伸手进腰带，拿出一颗白色的小胶囊。看起来和黑崎的心脏药一模一样。“我们要你救他。”</p>
<p>She placed the capsule next to the envelope.</p>
<p>她把胶囊放在信封旁边。</p>
<p>"Inside this is a message. Give it to him. Tell him it's from his 'loyalists'. Tell him it's the only way he survives tonight."</p>
<p>“这里面是一个信息。给他。告诉他这是他的‘死忠派’给他的。告诉他这是他今晚活下来的唯一机会。”</p>
<p>Sato looked at the capsule, then at the photos.</p>
<p>佐藤看着胶囊，又看着照片。</p>
<p>"What happens if I do this?"</p>
<p>“如果我做了会怎么样？”</p>
<p>"You walk away with your debts paid," Chen Mo leaned in. "Refuse, and Mishima will kill you anyway to tie up loose ends. We are your only lifeboat."</p>
<p>“你债务两清，全身而退，”陈默凑近说。“拒绝的话，三岛反正也会杀你灭口。我们是你唯一的救生艇。”</p></div>
