<p>第四十七章：祭坛上的狼</p>
<p>Three armored trucks smashed through the vegetation. They surrounded the ruins.</p>
<p>三辆装甲卡车撞穿植被。包围了废墟。</p>
<p>The Butcher stepped out. He wore a white suit, mocking the jungle's dirt. His broken finger was bandaged in purple silk.</p>
<p>屠夫走了出来。他穿着白西装，嘲弄着丛林的泥土。他断掉的手指包着紫色的丝绸。</p>
<p>"Mrs. Tanaka," he walked into the church, flanked by ten heavily armed guards. "You look... diminished."</p>
<p>“田中太太，”他走进教堂，两边跟着十个全副武装的卫兵。“你看起来……消瘦了。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko fell to her knees. She bowed her head, her hair covering her face.</p>
<p>美悦子跪倒在地。她低下头，头发遮住了脸。</p>
<p>"Please..." she held up a USB drive. "Take it. Let us go."</p>
<p>“求你……”她举起一个U盘。“拿去。放我们走。”</p>
<p>The Butcher laughed. He walked up to the altar, looming over her. He grabbed her chin with his good hand, forcing her to look up.</p>
<p>屠夫大笑。他走到祭坛前，笼罩着她。用完好的那只手捏住她的下巴，强迫她抬头。</p>
<p>"Let you go?" he sneered, his eyes roaming over her red dress, lingering on the sweat-soaked fabric clinging to her breasts. "After you broke my finger? No. I'm going to keep you. I have a cage for you in Medellin."</p>
<p>“放你走？”他冷笑，目光游走在她的红裙上，停留在紧贴乳房的湿透布料上。“在你折断我的手指之后？不。我要留着你。我在麦德林有个笼子专门给你留着。”</p>
<p>He reached for the USB drive.</p>
<p>他伸手去拿U盘。</p>
<p>"Where is the boy? The finger-breaker?"</p>
<p>“那个小子呢？那个折手指的？”</p>
<p>"Dead," Miyetsuko whispered. "Fever. In the jungle."</p>
<p>“死了，”美悦子低语。“发烧。在丛林里。”</p>
<p>"Pity. I wanted to skin him," The Butcher grabbed the drive. "Grab her."</p>
<p>“可惜。我还想剥了他的皮，”屠夫抓过U盘。“抓住她。”</p>
<p>Two guards moved forward to seize her arms.</p>
<p>两个卫兵上前抓她的胳膊。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko looked up. Her eyes weren't fearful. They were burning with a dark, manic joy.</p>
<p>美悦子抬起头。她的眼睛里没有恐惧。燃烧着一种黑暗、疯狂的快乐。</p>
<p>"He's not dead," she whispered. "He's the lightning."</p>
<p>“他没死，”她低语。“他是闪电。”</p></div>
