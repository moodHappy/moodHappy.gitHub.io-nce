<p>第三章：夕阳下的无人机</p>
<p>Just as Chen Mo leaned down to lick the melted ice water off her stomach, a buzzing sound caught his ear.</p>
<p>就在陈默俯身准备舔掉她肚子上的冰水时，一阵嗡嗡声引起了他的注意。</p>
<p>It wasn't a mosquito. It was mechanical.</p>
<p>不是蚊子。是机械声。</p>
<p>He looked up. A small black dot was hovering against the blinding sun, about 500 meters away.</p>
<p>他抬头。一个黑点悬停在刺眼的阳光下，大约500米远。</p>
<p>"Don't move," Chen Mo's voice dropped an octave. The playfulness vanished.</p>
<p>“别动，”陈默的声音低了八度。玩笑意消失了。</p>
<p>"What is it? Paparazzi?" Miyetsuko didn't open her eyes, enjoying his breath on her skin.</p>
<p>“什么东西？狗仔队？”美悦子没睁眼，享受着他皮肤上的气息。</p>
<p>"Too stable for a paparazzi drone. That's a military-grade spotter. MQ-19."</p>
<p>“对于狗仔队的无人机来说太稳了。那是军用级的侦察机。MQ-19。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo grabbed a towel and threw it over Miyetsuko.</p>
<p>陈默抓起一条毛巾扔在美悦子身上。</p>
<p>"Cover up. We are being watched."</p>
<p>“盖好。我们在被监视。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko sat up, pulling the towel around her shoulders. The thrill in her eyes was palpable. It wasn't fear; it was excitement.</p>
<p>美悦子坐起来，把毛巾裹在肩上。她眼中的兴奋显而易见。那不是恐惧；是兴奋。</p>
<p>"Kurosaki found us?"</p>
<p>“黑崎找到我们了？”</p>
<p>"Took him long enough," Chen Mo picked up the silenced pistol from the table. He aimed at the sun.</p>
<p>“他花的时间够久的，”陈默拿起桌上的消音手枪。他瞄准太阳。</p>
<p>Pffft.</p>
<p>噗。</p>
<p>The black dot in the sky wobbled, smoked, and spiraled down into the jungle below.</p>
<p>天空中的黑点晃动了一下，冒烟，然后螺旋坠入下方的丛林。</p>
<p>"He sent a scout," Chen Mo checked the magazine. "Which means the hit team is already in Rio."</p>
<p>“他派了侦察兵，”陈默检查弹夹。“这意味着杀手小组已经在里约了。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stood up. The gold bikini flashed under the towel.</p>
<p>美悦子站起身。金色比基尼在毛巾下若隐若现。</p>
<p>"Finally," she stretched, cracking her neck. "I was getting sick of just shooting watermelons. Tonight's party just got interesting."</p>
<p>“终于，”她伸了个懒腰，脖子发出咔咔声。“我都快厌倦只射西瓜了。今晚的派对变得有趣了。”</p>
<p>"We are walking into a trap if we go to that party," Chen Mo warned.</p>
<p>“如果我们去那个派对，就是走进陷阱，”陈默警告道。</p>
<p>"No, Chen," she walked past him, her hips swaying with a deadly rhythm. "We are walking into a hunting ground. And I intend to be the one eating tonight."</p>
<p>“不，陈，”她走过他身边，臀部以一种致命的节奏摇摆。“我们是走进猎场。而我打算做今晚进食的那一个。”</p></div>
