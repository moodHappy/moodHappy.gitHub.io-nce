<p>第六十五章：寡妇的祝酒</p>
<p>Chen Mo closed the laptop. The screen went black.</p>
<p>陈默合上笔记本电脑。屏幕黑了。</p>
<p>"It's done," he said.</p>
<p>“结束了，”他说。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko didn't cheer. She didn't laugh. She just stared at the blank screen where her husband had just died.</p>
<p>美悦子没有欢呼。没有笑。她只是盯着那个刚才她丈夫死去的黑屏。</p>
<p>Seven years of torture. The white kimono. The humiliation. The fear. It all ended in a dirty hallway with a trap set by her lover.</p>
<p>七年的折磨。那件白无垢。那些羞辱。那些恐惧。一切都在这肮脏的走廊里，在她情人设下的陷阱中结束了。</p>
<p>She walked to the window. The rain had stopped. Tokyo was glittering like a jewelry box.</p>
<p>她走到窗边。雨停了。东京像个珠宝盒一样闪闪发光。</p>
<p>"I don't feel sad," she whispered. "Is that wrong?"</p>
<p>“我不觉得难过，”她低声说。“这不对吗？”</p>
<p>"No," Chen Mo walked to her, handing her a fresh glass of wine. "It's freedom."</p>
<p>“不，”陈默走到她身边，递给她一杯新倒的酒。“这是自由。”</p>
<p>She took the glass. She looked at the red liquid, swirling it.</p>
<p>她接过杯子。看着红色的液体，摇晃着。</p>
<p>"To the Widow Kurosaki," she raised the glass to her reflection. "May she rest in peace."</p>
<p>“敬寡妇黑崎，”她对着倒影举杯。“愿她安息。”</p>
<p>"And to the Queen," Chen Mo clinked his glass against hers.</p>
<p>“敬女王，”陈默和她碰杯。</p>
<p>She drank it in one gulp. Then she smashed the glass against the floor.</p>
<p>她一饮而尽。然后把杯子狠狠摔碎在地板上。</p>
<p>"Now," she turned to Chen Mo, grabbing his lapels, her eyes burning with a ferocious light. "The old King is dead. Now we kill the Usurper."</p>
<p>“现在，”她转向陈默，抓住他的翻领，眼里燃烧着凶猛的光。“老国王死了。现在我们要杀篡位者。”</p>
<p>"Mishima," Chen Mo nodded.</p>
<p>“三岛，”陈默点头。</p>
<p>"He won't be as easy as a rat in a maze," she pulled Chen Mo towards the bedroom. "But tonight... tonight I want to sleep. For the first time in seven years, I want to sleep without dreaming."</p>
<p>“他不会像迷宫里的老鼠那么好对付，”她拉着陈默走向卧室。“但今晚……今晚我想睡觉。七年来第一次，我想睡个没有梦的觉。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo picked her up.</p>
<p>陈默抱起她。</p>
<p>"I'll watch over you," he promised.</p>
<p>“我会守着你，”他承诺。</p>
<p>And he did. As the sirens wailed in the distance towards the prison, the Queen slept soundly in the arms of her assassin.</p>
<p>他是这么做的。当远处的警笛声呼啸着冲向监狱时，女王在她的刺客怀里安然入睡。</p></div>
