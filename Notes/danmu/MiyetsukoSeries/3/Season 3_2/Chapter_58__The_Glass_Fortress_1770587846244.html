<p>第五十八章：玻璃堡垒</p>
<p>Aman Tokyo. The Corner Suite. 34th Floor.</p>
<p>东京安缦酒店。角房套房。34层。</p>
<p>The suite was a sanctuary of stone, wood, and silence. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of the Imperial Palace gardens and the glittering city beyond. It was a world away from the humid, rotting bunker in Rio.</p>
<p>套房是石头、木材和寂静的圣所。落地窗提供了皇居花园和远处闪耀城市的无敌全景。这与里约那个潮湿、腐烂的地堡简直是两个世界。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko kicked off her heels. She didn't turn on the lights. The city glow was enough.</p>
<p>美悦子踢掉高跟鞋。她没开灯。城市的微光就足够了。</p>
<p>She walked to the window, pressing her hand against the cold glass.</p>
<p>她走到窗前，手按在冰冷的玻璃上。</p>
<p>"We are back in the spider's web, Chen," she whispered. "Mishima has eyes everywhere. Even in this hotel."</p>
<p>“我们回到了蜘蛛网里，陈，”她低语。“三岛到处都有眼睛。甚至在这家酒店里。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo was sweeping the room with an RF detector. It beeped near a flower vase.</p>
<p>陈默正拿着射频探测器扫描房间。在花瓶附近，它发出了蜂鸣声。</p>
<p>"Found one," he plucked a tiny bug from under a lily. He crushed it between his fingers. "Amateur."</p>
<p>“找到一个，”他从百合花下摘出一个微型窃听器。用手指捏碎。“业余。”</p>
<p>He walked over to her. He was still wearing his suit, tie loosened. He looked tired but alert.</p>
<p>他走向她。他还穿着西装，领带松开了。看起来疲惫但警觉。</p>
<p>"We expected this," he stood behind her, looking at their reflection in the glass. Two predators in a glass cage. "Mishima is scared. Scared men listen."</p>
<p>“意料之中，”他站在她身后，看着玻璃里的倒影。两头困在玻璃笼子里的掠食者。“三岛在害怕。害怕的人才会偷听。”</p>
<p>"Let him listen," Miyetsuko turned around. She reached for his tie, unknotting it slowly. "Let him hear us celebrate."</p>
<p>“让他听，”美悦子转过身。她伸手去解他的领带，动作缓慢。“让他听听我们怎么庆祝。”</p></div>
