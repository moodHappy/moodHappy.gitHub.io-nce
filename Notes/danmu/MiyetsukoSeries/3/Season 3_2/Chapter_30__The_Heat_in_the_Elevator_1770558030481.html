<p>第三十章：电梯里的热度</p>
<p>They walked out of the chaotic club, leaving a room full of stunned gangsters.</p>
<p>他们走出混乱的俱乐部，留下一屋子目瞪口呆的黑帮分子。</p>
<p>They got into the private elevator that led to the roof.</p>
<p>他们进了通往屋顶的私人电梯。</p>
<p>As soon as the doors closed, the mask dropped.</p>
<p>门一关上，面具就摘下了。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko slumped against the wall, letting out a breath she had been holding for an hour. Her legs were trembling slightly.</p>
<p>美悦子瘫靠在墙上，吐出一口憋了一个小时的气。她的腿在微微发抖。</p>
<p>"Did you see his face?" she laughed, a nervous, high-pitched sound. "When you broke his finger... god, Chen. That was..."</p>
<p>“你看到他的脸了吗？”她笑了，那是紧张、尖锐的声音。“当你折断他手指的时候……天啊，陈。那真是……”</p>
<p>She grabbed Chen Mo's tie and pulled him close.</p>
<p>她抓住陈默的领带，把他拉近。</p>
<p>"That was so hot."</p>
<p>“太性感了。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo didn't speak. He pushed her against the mirrored wall of the elevator. His hands found the high slits of her Qipao, sliding up her thighs instantly.</p>
<p>陈默没说话。他把她推到电梯的镜面墙上。他的手找到了旗袍的高开叉，瞬间滑上她的大腿。</p>
<p>"You played a dangerous game," he muttered, his fingers gripping her soft flesh possessively. "If they had decided to shoot..."</p>
<p>“你玩了个危险的游戏，”他低声说，手指占有欲极强地抓着她柔软的肉。“如果他们决定开枪……”</p>
<p>"They didn't," she gasped, arching into his touch. "Because you were there. My wolf."</p>
<p>“他们没有，”她喘息着，迎合着他的触碰。“因为你在那儿。我的狼。”</p>
<p>She lifted her leg, wrapping it around his waist. The black silk bunching up at her waist revealed she wasn't wearing anything underneath the Qipao.</p>
<p>她抬起腿，缠在他的腰上。黑色丝绸在腰间堆积，暴露出她在旗袍下面什么都没穿。</p>
<p>"You wore this... commando? To a meeting with gangsters?" Chen Mo's eyes darkened.</p>
<p>“你穿成这样……真空？去见那群黑帮？”陈默的眼神暗了下来。</p>
<p>"I knew it would distract you," she bit his lip. "I wanted you to think about this... while you were breaking fingers."</p>
<p>“我知道这会让你分心，”她咬住他的嘴唇。“我想让你一边折断手指……一边想着这个。”</p>
<p>The elevator dinged. They were on the roof. But neither moved.</p>
<p>电梯叮了一声。到了屋顶。但两人都没动。</p>
<p>"Don't stop," she whispered, her hands clawing at his back. "Right here. In the elevator. Before the doors open."</p>
<p>“别停，”她低语，双手在他背上抓挠。“就在这儿。电梯里。在门开之前。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo pressed the emergency stop button.</p>
<p>陈默按下了紧急停止按钮。</p>
<p>In the suspended steel box, high above the violent city, the Queen and her Knight engaged in a battle of their own—a battle of sweat, silk, and desperate need.</p>
<p>在这个悬挂在暴力城市上空的钢铁盒子里，女王和她的骑士开始了属于他们自己的战斗——一场关于汗水、丝绸和绝望需求的战斗。</p></div>
