<p>Chapter 3: The Umbrella Confrontation</p>
<p>第三章：伞下的对峙</p>
<p>As the crowd dispersed, Mishima walked up to her. His bodyguards flanked him, tense and ready.</p>
<p>人群散去时，三岛走向她。他的保镖护在两侧，紧绷着神经。</p>
<p>"A beautiful service, Mrs. Kurosaki," Mishima said, his voice low. "Or should I say... Mrs. Tanaka?"</p>
<p>“葬礼很美，黑崎夫人，”三岛低声说。“或者我该叫你……田中太太？”</p>
<p>"Miyetsuko is fine," she replied calmly. Chen Mo stepped slightly forward, placing himself between Mishima and her.</p>
<p>“叫美悦子就好，”她平静地回答。陈默稍微上前一步，挡在她和三岛之间。</p>
<p>"He died at a very... convenient time," Mishima looked at Chen Mo, then back at her. "Just as you returned. Just as the security system failed."</p>
<p>“他死得非常……及时，”三岛看了看陈默，又看回她。“就在你回来的时候。就在安保系统失效的时候。”</p>
<p>"Life is full of coincidences, Mishima-san," she lifted her veil.</p>
<p>“生活充满了巧合，三岛先生，”她掀起了面纱。</p>
<p>Her face was dry. Her makeup was perfect. Her lips were a shocking shade of red.</p>
<p>她的脸是干的。妆容完美。嘴唇涂着令人震惊的红色。</p>
<p>"And death... is full of opportunities."</p>
<p>“而死亡……充满了机遇。”</p>
<p>Mishima stepped closer. The rain drummed harder on the umbrellas.</p>
<p>三岛逼近一步。雨点更猛烈地敲打着伞面。</p>
<p>"You think you won because the old dog is dead? I am not Kurosaki. I don't want to break you. I want to erase you."</p>
<p>“你以为老狗死了你就赢了？我不是黑崎。我不想折磨你。我想抹除你。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko laughed. A genuine, light laugh that echoed in the cemetery.</p>
<p>美悦子笑了。一声真诚、轻快的笑声在墓地回荡。</p>
<p>"Try it," she whispered. "But remember, I have the jungle in my blood now. And in the jungle... the predator doesn't roar before it bites."</p>
<p>“试试看，”她低语。“但记住，我的血里现在流淌着丛林。而在丛林里……掠食者咬人之前是不会吼叫的。”</p>
<p>She turned her back on him.</p>
<p>她背过身去。</p>
<p>"Let's go, Chen. The air here stinks of yesterday."</p>
<p>“走吧，陈。这儿的空气有一股昨天的臭味。”</p>
