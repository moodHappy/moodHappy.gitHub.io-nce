<p>Chapter 54: The Aftermath of Emerald</p>
<p>第五十四章：翡翠余烬</p>
<p>The Ridge overlooking the Mekong. Dusk.</p>
<p>俯瞰湄公河的山脊。黄昏。</p>
<p>The river was unrecognizable. It was a vast, scarred plain of grey mud and broken timber. The "Black Lotus" fortress sat like a broken tooth in the center of the destruction.</p>
<p>大河已变得满目疮痍。那是一片由灰泥和断木组成的广阔而满是伤痕的平原。“黑莲花”堡垒像一颗断牙般立在毁灭的中心。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko sat on a rock, wrapped in a rough wool blanket Chen Mo had found. Her feet were bare and cut, the Golden Derringer lying beside her, covered in silt.</p>
<p>美悦子坐在岩石上，裹着陈默找到的粗羊毛毯。她赤着脚，上面布满伤口，金色德林加手枪沾满泥沙，躺在她身边。</p>
<p>Chen Mo sat behind her, cleaning a portable satellite uplink. They were isolated. The network was dark. The army they had built was scattered.</p>
<p>陈默坐在她身后，清理着便携式卫星上行链路。他们被隔离了。网络已断。他们建立的军队也溃散了。</p>
<p>"We've lost 70% of the infrastructure," Chen Mo said quietly. "Mishima didn't just try to kill us. He erased our base of operations."</p>
<p>“我们损失了70%的基础设施，”陈默轻声说道。“三岛不仅仅想杀了我们。他抹除了我们的行动基地。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko looked at the survivors huddling by small fires below—the slaves and soldiers who now looked at her not with fear, but with something new.</p>
<p>美悦子看着下方围在小火堆旁缩成一团的幸存者——那些现在不再用恐惧、而是用某种全新的眼神看着她的奴隶和士兵。</p>
<p>"No," she said, her voice raspy but iron-strong. "He gave me exactly what I needed. A legend."</p>
<p>“不，”她说道，声音沙哑却坚如钢铁。“他恰恰给了我想要的东西。一个传说。”</p>
<p>"The girl in the white kimono is gone. The Widow of the Mekong is gone."</p>
<p>“穿白无垢的女孩消失了。湄公河的寡妇也消失了。”</p>
<p>"From the mud, the Goddess of the Damned has risen."</p>
<p>“从泥潭中，被诅咒者的女神已经升起。”</p>
<p>She turned to Chen Mo, the blanket falling away to reveal the raw, bruised power of her body.</p>
<p>她转向陈默，毛毯滑落，露出她那充满原始、淤青力量的身体。</p>
<p>"He thought the river would drown me. Now, I'm going to turn the river into a flood that burns down Tokyo."</p>
<p>“他以为大河会淹没我。现在，我要把大河变成一场烧毁东京的洪灾。”</p>
