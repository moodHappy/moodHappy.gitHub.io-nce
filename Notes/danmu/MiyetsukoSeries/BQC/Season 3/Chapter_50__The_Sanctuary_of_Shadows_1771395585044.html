<p>Chapter 50: The Sanctuary of Shadows</p>
<p>第五十章：暗影避难所</p>
<p>The hall was silent again, the body in the glass box a grim monument to Mishima's desperation.</p>
<p>大厅再次陷入寂静，玻璃箱里的尸体成了三岛垂死挣扎的阴冷纪念碑。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko turned to Chen Mo, who was already initiating the decontamination sequence.</p>
<p>美悦子转向陈默，他已经开始启动去污程序。</p>
<p>She walked to him, the white silk of her dress stained with the imaginary blood of the encounter.</p>
<p>她走向他，白丝长裙仿佛沾染了这场邂逅中臆想出来的鲜血。</p>
<p>She pulled him close, her hands finding the warmth of his neck, her body trembling with a mix of fury and relief.</p>
<p>她将他拉近，双手寻找着他颈部的温度，身体因为愤怒与宽慰的交织而颤抖。</p>
<p>"He tried to take the air from my lungs, Chen," she murmured, her face buried in his chest.</p>
<p>“陈，他想夺走我肺里的空气，”她在他怀里低声呢喃。</p>
<p>"He thinks he can reach me anywhere. He thinks I am still that girl in the white kimono."</p>
<p>“他以为他在任何地方都能抓到我。他以为我还是那个穿白无垢的女孩。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo held her with a fierce, protective grip, his gaze fixed on the dead man in the box.</p>
<p>陈默以一种强烈的保护姿态抱着她，目光死死盯着箱里的死人。</p>
<p>"He just signed his own death warrant," Chen Mo growled, his voice a dark promise.</p>
<p>“他刚刚签下了他自己的死亡证明，”陈默低吼道，声音里带着黑暗的诺言。</p>
<p>"We aren't waiting for him to come to us anymore. We are going to Tokyo, and we are going to tear his world apart."</p>
<p>“我们不再等他上门了。我们要回东京，我们要把他的世界撕成碎片。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko looked up, the white silk of her gown reflecting the red emergency lights, turning her into a vision of blood and snow.</p>
<p>美悦子抬起头，白丝长裙映照着红色的应急灯光，将她映衬成一幅血与雪交织的幻象。</p>
<p>"Yes," she whispered, her smile a beautiful, final omen. "Let the Queen return to her ruins."</p>
<p>“是的，”她低声说道，笑容如同一抹华丽而终极的预兆。“让女王回到她的废墟中去吧。”</p>
