<p>Chapter 28: The Blood Ransom</p>
<p>第二十八章：鲜血赎金</p>
<p>Lin’s hand moved lower, his breath hot and smelling of greed against her neck.</p>
<p>林主席的手向下移，呼吸热辣且带着贪婪的味道，喷在她的颈间。</p>
<p>"The price for your life is one night, Miyetsuko," he growled, his fingers tightening on her waist.</p>
<p>“救你命的代价就是一个夜晚，美悦子，”他低吼道，手指在她的腰间收紧。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko leaned back against the marble desk, her eyes locking onto his with a terrifying, calm clarity.</p>
<p>美悦子向后靠在黑大理石桌上，眼神带着一种令人恐惧、冷静而清澈的光芒锁住了他。</p>
<p>"I have paid many prices to reach this river, Chairman," she whispered, her voice a silk cord.</p>
<p>“为了来到这条大河，我已经付出了许多代价，主席，”她低声呢喃，声音如同一根丝弦。</p>
<p>"But there is a law that governs my body. A law you are about to learn."</p>
<p>“但我的身体有一条法则。一条你即将领教的法则。”</p>
<p>As Lin pulled her closer, his lips seeking her throat, Miyetsuko reached down to the garter on her inner thigh.</p>
<p>当林主席将她拉近，嘴唇寻找着她的喉咙时，美悦子伸手摸向了大腿内侧的枪带。</p>
<p>The Golden Derringer felt hot in her hand, a small, gilded instrument of finality.</p>
<p>金色德林加在手中感觉发烫，那是一件精巧、镀金的终结工具。</p>
<p>She didn't hesitate. She pressed the muzzle against his groin and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>她没有犹豫。她将枪口顶在他的裆部，扣动了扳机。</p>
<p>BANG.</p>
<p>砰。</p>
<p>The sound was muffled by his own scream of agony as he collapsed to the floor, clutching his ruined manhood.</p>
<p>闷响被他痛苦的尖叫声淹没，他瘫倒在地，紧紧捂住被废掉的命根子。</p>
<p>Chen Mo burst through the door, his silenced pistol coughing twice, dropping the guards in the hallway before they could speak.</p>
<p>陈默冲进门，加装消音器的手枪轻咳了两声，在走廊的警卫还没来得及开口前就将他们击倒。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stood over the writhing Chairman, the silver silk of her dress stained with his panicked blood.</p>
<p>美悦子站在翻滚的主席身旁，银色丝绸长裙沾染了他惊恐的鲜血。</p>
<p>"I don't need your protection, Lin," she whispered, looking down at him with pure indifference.</p>
<p>“我不需要你的庇护，林，”她低声说道，极其冷漠地俯视着他。</p>
<p>"I need your servers. I need your slaves. And now, I own them all."</p>
<p>“我要你的服务器。我要你的奴隶。而现在，他们全部归我了。”</p>
