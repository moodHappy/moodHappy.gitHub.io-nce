<p>Chapter 12: The Serpent's Choice</p>
<p>第十二章：毒蛇的抉择</p>
<p>Vang tapped his fingers on the table, the rhythm matching the slow, heavy heartbeat of the river.</p>
<p>旺将军的手指敲击着桌面，那节奏与河流缓慢而沉重的脉搏相呼应。</p>
<p>"In these waters, trust is a currency no one can afford," he murmured, his voice a dry rasp.</p>
<p>“在这些水域，信任是没人付得起的货币，”他低声说道，声音沙哑干涩。</p>
<p>He gestured to two jade cups on the table, filled with a dark, aromatic liquid.</p>
<p>他示意桌上的两个玉杯，杯中盛满了深色且带有芳香的液体。</p>
<p>"One is seasoned with the nectar of the lotus; the other with the venom of a king cobra."</p>
<p>“一杯调入了莲花的蜜露；另一杯则掺进了眼镜王蛇的毒液。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko felt the heavy humidity of the room pressing against her skin, making the emerald silk of her sarong cling to her thighs.</p>
<p>美悦子感觉到屋内沉重的湿气压迫着她的肌肤，翡翠色的丝绸纱笼紧紧贴在她的双腿上。</p>
<p>The heat was a living thing, coiling around her like a predator waiting for a mistake.</p>
<p>热浪仿佛一个活物，像等待失误的掠食者般缠绕着她。</p>
<p>She looked at Chen Mo, whose hand was a steady shadow near his blade, his loyalty a silent anchor in the storm.</p>
<p>她看向陈默，他的手稳如阴影般停在刀柄旁，他的忠诚是这场风暴中无声的锚。</p>
<p>"You want me to gamble my life for your respect, General?" she asked, her voice like silk over a razor.</p>
<p>“将军，你想让我用性命博取你的尊重？”她问道，声音犹如覆盖在剃刀上的丝绸。</p>
<p>"I want to see if the Queen's luck is as legendary as her beauty," Vang replied with a cold, obsidian grin.</p>
<p>“我想看看女王的运气是否如她的美貌般传神，”旺将军带着冰冷的黑曜石般的微笑回答。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko reached out, her fingers grazing the cool surface of the jade, the golden derringer a burning weight against her inner thigh.</p>
<p>美悦子伸出手，手指擦过玉杯冰冷的表面，大腿内侧那把金色德林加手枪散发着灼热的重量。</p>
<p>She didn't hesitate; she lifted the cup on the left and drained it, her eyes never leaving the General's.</p>
<p>她毫不犹豫地举起左边的杯子一饮而尽，目光始终没有离开将军。</p>
<p>A silence deeper than the jungle fell over the room as she set the empty cup down.</p>
<p>当她放下空杯时，一阵比丛林还要深沉的寂静笼罩了房间。</p>
<p>The dark liquid burned a path down her throat, but her breath remained steady, her pulse a rhythmic defiance against the reaper.</p>
<p>深色的液体灼烧着她的喉咙，但她的呼吸依旧平稳，脉搏是有节奏的对死神的轻蔑。</p>
<p>Vang watched her for a long minute, the tension in the room a tightened wire ready to snap.</p>
<p>旺将军注视了她良久，屋内的紧张气氛如同拉满到即将断裂的钢丝。</p>
<p>Then, he slowly began to clap, the sound echoing through the hollow ribs of the riverboat.</p>
<p>随后，他缓缓开始鼓掌，那声音在河船空洞的肋架间回荡。</p>
<p>"You have the heart of a cobra, Miyetsuko," he said, the respect in his voice a new, dangerous edge.</p>
<p>“美悦子，你有一颗眼镜蛇的心，”他说道，声音里的尊重带着一种全新的、危险的锋芒。</p>
