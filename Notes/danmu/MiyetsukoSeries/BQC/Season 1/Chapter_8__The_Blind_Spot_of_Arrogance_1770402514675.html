<p>第八章：傲慢的盲区</p>
<p>Chen Mo did not lose his mind despite the temptation close at hand. He stepped back, escaping the suffocatingly sweet pressure, his eyes sharp.</p>
<p>陈默没有因为近在咫尺的诱惑而冲昏头脑。他退后一步，从那股窒息的香甜压迫中挣脱出来，眼神锐利。</p>
<p>"Wait. There is a logical flaw in your plan." Chen Mo stared at her. "You just said, 'Anyone you contact in Tokyo will be reported.' I walked in here with your card, through the front door. The surveillance cameras outside definitely captured me. If your husband is really that terrifying, I'm probably already a dead man."</p>
<p>“等等。你的计划有个逻辑漏洞。”陈默盯着她。“你刚才说，‘你在东京接触的任何人都会被汇报’。我拿着你的卡，大摇大摆走进这里。外面的监控肯定拍到了我。如果你丈夫真那么可怕，我现在恐怕已经是个死人了。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko froze for a moment, then a look of appreciation flashed in her eyes. She laughed, a low, trembling laugh that caused the heavy softness beneath the silk dress to quake violently.</p>
<p>美悦子愣了一下，随即眼中闪过一丝赞赏。她笑了起来，笑声低沉，震得那丝绸裙下沉甸甸的软肉一阵剧烈乱颤。</p>
<p>"Smart man. I really didn't choose the wrong person."
“聪明的男人。我果然没选错人。”</p>
<p>She walked back to the sofa and sat down, crossing her legs. The high slit of her skirt slid down, revealing a large expanse of dazzlingly white thigh flesh, rich and tight, like creamy pudding solidified.</p>
<p>她走回沙发坐下，翘起二郎腿。高开叉的裙摆滑落，露出一大片晃眼的大腿软肉，丰腴紧致，像凝固的奶油布丁。</p>
<p>"They certainly know you're here. In fact, the report is probably already on the old man's desk: 'Mrs. Kurosaki met a young man in a private club.'" She took a drag from her cigarette, her expression turning sarcastic. "But you don't understand men like Kurosaki. Or rather, you don't understand the arrogance of power."</p>
<p>“他们当然知道你在这儿。事实上，报告可能已经放在那个老头子的桌上了：‘黑崎夫人在私人俱乐部见了一个年轻男人’。”她吸了一口烟，神情变得讥讽。“但你不了解黑崎那种男人。或者说，你不了解权力的傲慢。”</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>“什么意思？”</p>
<p>"To him, I am just a canary he keeps in a cage. If I meet a politician, a business rival, or a journalist, he will be alert, he will kill. But you?" Miyetsuko looked Chen Mo up and down with a teasing gaze. "You are just a nobody, a corporate slave with a clean background."</p>
<p>“对他来说，我只是他养在笼子里的一只金丝雀。如果我见的是政客、商业对手或者记者，他会警觉，会杀人。但是你？”美悦子用一种玩味的目光上下打量陈默。“你只是个无名小卒，一个背景干净的社畜。”</p>
<p>She stood up again, her voice dipping into a hush.</p>
<p>她再次站起身，声音低了下去。</p>
<p>"If I meet you for 'business,' he will suspect. But if I meet you for... 'lust'? He will only think his pet is in heat and looking for a toy to relieve boredom. He despises my body, so he thinks everyone who covets my body is lowly and harmless."</p>
<p>“如果我和你谈‘生意’，他会起疑。但如果我是为了……‘欲望’呢？他只会觉得他的宠物发情了，找了个玩具解闷。他轻视我的身体，所以他觉得所有贪图我身体的人，都是低贱且无害的。”</p></div>
