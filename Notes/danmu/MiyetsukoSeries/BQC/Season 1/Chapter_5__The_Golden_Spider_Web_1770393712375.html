<p>第五章：金色的蛛网</p>
<p>"The Nest" was quieter than Chen Mo had imagined. There was no deafening music, only the low murmur of jazz cello flowing like mercury near the floor.</p>
<p>“巢穴”比陈默想象中安静。没有震耳欲聋的音乐，只有低沉的爵士大提琴声像水银一样在地板附近流淌。</p>
<p>The air was thick with the scents of aged brandy, expensive cigars, and various complex perfumes mixing together—the smell of money and secrets fermenting. Everyone here wore a perfect mask; their polite nods hid evaluative gazes.</p>
<p>空气里混杂着陈年白兰地、昂贵雪茄和各种复杂香水混合在一起的味道——那是金钱和秘密发酵的气味。这里每个人都戴着完美的面具，礼貌的颔首之后是互相估价的眼神。</p>
<p>Chen Mo, in his off-the-rack suit, felt like a stray dog mingling into a wolf pack's dinner party. He clutched the black card tightly, his palms slightly sweaty.</p>
<p>穿着成衣西装的陈默，觉得自己像是一条混进了狼群晚宴的流浪狗。他紧紧捏着那张黑卡，手心微微出汗。</p>
<p>A waiter wearing white gloves silently appeared in front of him, glancing at the card in his hand with no change in expression.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, please follow me. Madam is waiting for you in the 'Orchid Room'."</p>
<p>一个戴着白手套的侍应生无声地出现在他面前，目光扫过他手中的卡片，神色没有丝毫变化。</p>
<p>“陈先生，请跟我来。夫人在‘兰花厅’等您。”</p>
<p>He knew my surname was Chen? She really had investigated him thoroughly.</p>
<p>知道他姓陈？她果然把自己查了个底朝天。</p>
<p>They passed through a long, dimly lit corridor lined with velvet-covered private booths. Sounds of suppressed laughter or intense whispering occasionally leaked from behind heavy curtains. Chen Mo felt like he was walking deeper into a colossal beast's intestine.</p>
<p>穿过一条幽暗的长廊，两侧全是包裹着天鹅绒的私密卡座。厚重的帘幕后偶尔泄露出一两声压抑的笑声，或者激烈的低语。陈默觉得自己正走向一只巨兽的肠道深处。</p>
<p>The waiter stopped in front of a heavily carved wooden door at the very end and pushed it open noiselessly.</p>
<p>"He has arrived."</p>
<p>侍应生在尽头一扇雕花厚木门前停下，无声地推开了门。</p>
<p>“人到了。”</p></div>
