<p>第十六章：死刑判决</p>
<p>The side door opened with a beep. The cloned card worked perfectly.</p>
<p>侧门“滴”的一声开了。克隆卡完美生效。</p>
<p>Chen Mo slipped into the corridor. The air inside was dry and cold, smelling of anti-static dust. He followed the map in his memory, sprinting towards the basement server room.</p>
<p>陈默闪身进入走廊。里面的空气干燥阴冷，带着防静电灰尘的味道。他沿着记忆中的地图，向地下机房狂奔。</p>
<p>Every second counted. He knew what Miyetsuko was doing in that guard room to buy him time. The thought of that fat guard's hands touching the skin he had touched made him sick, but also strangely excited.</p>
<p>每一秒都很珍贵。他知道美悦子在那间保安室里正在用什么方式为他争取时间。一想到那个胖保安的手可能会触碰到他也曾触碰过的皮肤，他就感到恶心，但又有一种诡异的亢奋。</p>
<p>Basement Level 2. Server Room A.</p>
<p>地下二层。机房A。</p>
<p>He arrived at the heavy metal door. He took out the silicone film, carefully stuck it on his thumb, and pressed it against the scanner.</p>
<p>他来到了那扇厚重的金属门前。掏出硅胶膜，小心翼翼地贴在大拇指上，按在扫描仪上。</p>
<p>Beep. Access Granted.</p>
<p>滴。验证通过。</p>
<p>The door hissed open. A wave of blue light and the roaring sound of cooling fans hit him. Rows of black server cabinets stood like silent tombstones.</p>
<p>大门嘶嘶作响地滑开。一股蓝色的光芒和散热风扇的轰鸣声扑面而来。一排排黑色的服务器机柜像沉默的墓碑一样矗立着。</p>
<p>Chen Mo rushed to the main terminal. His fingers flew across the keyboard.</p>
<p>陈默冲到主终端前。手指在键盘上飞舞。</p>
<p>"Insert Drive."</p>
<p>“插入驱动器。”</p>
<p>He plugged in the USB drive that still carried Miyetsuko's body temperature.</p>
<p>他插上了那个还带着美悦子体温的U盘。</p>
<p>Loading Trojan... 10%... 30%...</p>
<p>木马加载中……10%……30%……</p>
<p>The progress bar crawled agonizingly slow. Chen Mo's sweat dripped onto the keyboard.</p>
<p>进度条爬得令人抓狂地慢。陈默的汗水滴在键盘上。</p>
<p>Suddenly, a pop-up window appeared on the screen. It wasn't the file list he expected.</p>
<p>突然，屏幕上弹出了一个窗口。那不是他预想的文件列表。</p>
<p>It was a folder named: "Project: Honey Trap - Subject 1024".</p>
<p>而是一个文件夹，名字叫：“计划：美人计——实验体1024”。</p>
<p>Chen Mo's heart stopped. 1024. That number on the lipstick.</p>
<p>陈默的心脏停跳了一拍。1024。那个口红上的数字。</p>
<p>He trembling clicked open the folder.</p>
<p>他颤抖着点开了文件夹。</p>
<p>Inside were photos. Hundreds of photos.</p>
<p>里面是照片。几百张照片。</p>
<p>Photos of him eating alone. Photos of him working late. Photos of him entering the Izu inn.</p>
<p>他独自吃饭的照片。他加班的照片。他进入伊豆旅馆的照片。</p>
<p>And... photos of him and Miyetsuko in the hotel room that night, taken from hidden camera angles.</p>
<p>还有……那天晚上他和美悦子在旅馆房间里的照片，那是从隐蔽摄像头角度拍摄的。</p>
<p>Upload Complete.</p>
<p>上传完成。</p>
<p>The screen flashed green. But Chen Mo felt cold all over.</p>
<p>屏幕闪过绿光。但陈默浑身冰凉。</p>
<p>This wasn't a list of arms deals.</p>
<p>这不是什么军火交易名单。</p>
<p>He wasn't here to steal Kurosaki's secrets.</p>
<p>他不是来偷黑崎的秘密的。</p>
<p>He was here to upload his own evidence of the affair into Kurosaki's internal database.</p>
<p>他是来把他自己偷情的证据，上传到黑崎的内部数据库里的。</p>
<p>"Why..." Chen Mo muttered.</p>
<p>“为什么……”陈默喃喃自语。</p>
<p>At that moment, the walkie-talkie on his waist (which Miyetsuko gave him) crackled.</p>
<p>就在这时，他腰间的对讲机（美悦子给他的）响了。</p>
<p>"Chen, are you done?" Miyetsuko's voice came through, sounding calm, no longer the "drunk" voice. "The guard is asleep."</p>
<p>“陈，好了吗？”美悦子的声音传来，冷静，不再是那种“醉酒”的声调。“保安睡着了。”</p>
<p>"What did I just upload?" Chen Mo asked, his voice shaking with rage.</p>
<p>“我刚才上传了什么？”陈默的声音因愤怒而颤抖。</p>
<p>There was silence on the other end for two seconds.</p>
<p>对面沉默了两秒。</p>
<p>"You uploaded your death sentence, and my freedom." Her voice was cold, carrying a hint of apology, but mostly the ruthlessness of a survivor. "Goodbye, Mr. Chen."</p>
<p>“你上传了你的死刑判决书，和我的自由。”她的声音很冷，带着一丝歉意，但更多的是幸存者的决绝。“再见，陈先生。”</p>
<p>Click. The connection was cut.</p>
<p>咔哒。通讯切断。</p>
<p>Immediately, the red alarm lights in the server room began to spin wildly. The heavy metal door behind him began to close slowly.</p>
<p>紧接着，机房里的红色警报灯疯狂旋转起来。身后的厚重金属门开始缓缓关闭。</p>
<p>Alarm! Intruder Detected in Sector A!</p>
<p>警报！A区发现入侵者！</p></div>
