<p>第十九章：里约的新法则</p>
<p>"Command?" Fantasma laughed nervously. "Lady, you are brave. But this is my boat. These are my men."</p>
<p>“指挥？”幽灵紧张地笑了。“女士，你很勇敢。但这可是我的船。这些人是我的手下。”</p>
<p>He gestured to the dozen armed guards around them.</p>
<p>他指了指周围那十几名武装警卫。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko didn't even look at them. She looked at the tablet in the glass.</p>
<p>美悦子看都没看他们一眼。她看着杯子里的平板。</p>
<p>"That tablet contains the port authority codes. With it, I can move your cocaine through customs without inspection. Without it... you are just a thug with too much product and no way to sell it."</p>
<p>“那个平板里有港务局的代码。有了它，我可以让你的可卡因通过海关而不受检查。没有它……你只是个囤积了太多货却卖不出去的流氓。”</p>
<p>She straightened up, letting the robe fall open completely for a second before wrapping it tight. That brief flash of her blood-streaked, magnificent body was a calculated move. It wasn't nudity; it was a display of raw power. It said: I have nothing to hide, and nothing to fear.</p>
<p>她直起身，让睡袍完全敞开了一秒，然后紧紧裹住。那一瞬间，她那布满血痕、宏伟的身体一闪而过，那是经过计算的举动。那不是裸露；那是原始力量的展示。它在说：我无所隐瞒，也无所畏惧。</p>
<p>"Your men follow money, Fantasma. I can make them rich. Can you?"</p>
<p>“你的人是跟着钱走的，幽灵。我能让他们发财。你能吗？”</p>
<p>Fantasma stared at her. He looked at the blood on her skin, the fire in her eyes, and the absolute lack of shame.</p>
<p>幽灵盯着她。他看着她皮肤上的血，眼里的火，还有那绝对的无耻。</p>
<p>He had seen many killers. But he had never seen a woman who wore murder like a diamond necklace.</p>
<p>他见过很多杀手。但他从未见过一个把谋杀像钻石项链一样戴在身上的女人。</p>
<p>"You are crazy," Fantasma whispered. "A bruja (witch)."</p>
<p>“你疯了，”幽灵低语。“是个女巫。”</p>
<p>"I am necessary," she corrected him. She picked up his cigar from the ashtray, took a drag, and blew the smoke into his face.</p>
<p>“我是必须的，”她纠正他。她从烟灰缸里拿起他的雪茄，吸了一口，把烟雾吐在他脸上。</p>
<p>"Clean the cabin. Dump the body in the Atlantic. And get me a clean dress. Something white."</p>
<p>“清理船舱。把尸体扔进大西洋。给我找件干净的裙子。要白色的。”</p>
<p>She turned to walk away, the silk robe trailing behind her on the bloody deck.</p>
<p>她转身走开，丝绸睡袍在她身后的血腥甲板上拖曳。</p>
<p>"Wait," Fantasma called out. "What about him?" He pointed at Chen Mo.</p>
<p>“等等，”幽灵叫道。“那他呢？”他指着陈默。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stopped. She looked back at Chen Mo.</p>
<p>美悦子停下。她回头看陈默。</p>
<p>Chen Mo was wiping his bloody hands on a napkin, his expression unreadable.</p>
<p>陈默正在用餐巾擦拭血手，表情难以捉摸。</p>
<p>"He is my leash," she smiled, a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Without him, I might bite you."</p>
<p>“他是我的狗链，”她笑了，笑意未达眼底。“没有他，我可能会咬死你。”</p>
<p>Fantasma shivered. He looked at his men.</p>
<p>幽灵打了个寒颤。他看了看他的手下。</p>
<p>"Do as she says," he ordered quietly. "Dump the pig."</p>
<p>“照她说的做，”他低声命令。“把那头猪扔了。”</p></div>
