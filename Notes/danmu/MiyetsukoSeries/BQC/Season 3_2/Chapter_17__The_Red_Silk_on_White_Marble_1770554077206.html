<p>第十七章：白大理石上的红丝绸</p>
<p>The door to the master cabin opened.</p>
<p>主船舱的门开了。</p>
<p>The deck was quiet. The fireworks had stopped, leaving only the sound of waves lapping against the hull. Fantasma and his guards were waiting, expecting a whimpering, broken woman.</p>
<p>甲板上一片死寂。烟花停了，只剩下海浪拍打船体的声音。幽灵和他的手下在等待，他们以为会看到一个哭泣、破碎的女人。</p>
<p>Instead, they saw a goddess of death.</p>
<p>相反，他们看到了一尊死亡女神。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko walked out. She hadn't washed. The blood of the Police Chief—dark, drying, sticky—was painted across her collarbone, streaked down her thighs, and splattered like abstract art across her pale breasts.</p>
<p>美悦子走了出来。她没洗澡。警察局长的血——暗红、干涸、粘稠——涂抹在她的锁骨上，顺着大腿流下，像抽象艺术一样溅在她苍白的胸口。</p>
<p>She wore nothing but a translucent white silk robe, unbelted. It floated behind her like a ghost, catching the sea breeze.</p>
<p>她只披了一件透明的白色丝绸睡袍，没有系腰带。它像幽灵一样在她身后飘动，捕捉着海风。</p>
<p>As she walked, the robe parted. The flash of her bare skin—stained with blood and sweat—was shocking. But what was more shocking was her stride. It wasn't the walk of a survivor; it was the march of a conqueror.</p>
<p>随着她的走动，睡袍分开。她裸露的皮肤——沾着血和汗——在灯光下一闪而过，令人心惊。但更令人震惊的是她的步伐。那不是幸存者的步伐；那是征服者的行进。</p>
<p>In her hand, she held the tablet. It was dripping.</p>
<p>在她手里，拿着那个平板电脑。它还在滴血。</p>
<p>Chen Mo followed a step behind, his face grim, his waiter's vest stained with the same blood. He looked less like a servant now, and more like an executioner guarding his queen.</p>
<p>陈默跟在她身后一步，脸色阴沉，侍应生的马甲上也沾着同样的血。他现在看起来不像个仆人，更像是个守护女王的刽子手。</p></div>
