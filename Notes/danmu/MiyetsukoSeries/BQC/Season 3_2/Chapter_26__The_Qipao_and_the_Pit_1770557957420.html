    <div class="content"><p>Chapter 26: The Qipao and the Pit</p>
<p>第二十六章：旗袍与斗兽场</p>
<p>"The Devil's Throat." That was the name of Fantasma's underground casino and fighting pit, buried deep within the labyrinth of the favela.</p>
<p>“魔鬼喉咙”。这是幽灵的地下赌场和格斗场的名字，深埋在贫民窟的迷宫深处。</p>
<p>The air was thick with cigar smoke, the smell of roasted meat, and the roar of a bloodthirsty crowd. In the center, inside a chain-link cage, two fighters were beating each other into pulp.</p>
<p>空气中弥漫着雪茄烟雾、烤肉味和嗜血人群的咆哮声。在中央的铁丝网笼子里，两个拳手正把对方打成肉泥。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko walked in.</p>
<p>美悦子走了进来。</p>
<p>She wasn't wearing Western dress tonight. She wore a black silk Qipao.</p>
<p>今晚她没穿西式礼服。她穿了一件黑色的丝绸旗袍。</p>
<p>It was a garment designed to kill. The high collar gave her an air of forbidden strictness, but the slit... the slit went all the way up to her hip bone, exposing a long, pale leg with every step. The silk was tight, outlining the terrifyingly perfect curve of her waist and the heavy swell of her chest, wrapping her like a second skin of ink.</p>
<p>这是一件为了杀戮而设计的衣服。高领赋予她一种禁欲的严厉感，但开叉……开叉一直延伸到髋骨，每走一步都露出一修长苍白的大腿。丝绸紧紧裹着她，勾勒出那令人恐惧的完美腰线和胸前沉甸甸的起伏，像第二层墨色的皮肤。</p>
<p>She held a folding fan made of black lace.</p>
<p>她手里拿着一把黑色蕾丝折扇。</p>
<p>Chen Mo followed half a step behind. He wore a sharp black suit, no tie, his shirt unbuttoned at the top. He looked like her shadow. Silent. Lethal.</p>
<p>陈默跟在半步之后。他穿着一身利落的黑西装，没打领带，衬衫领口敞开。他看起来像她的影子。沉默。致命。</p>
<p>"Look at them," Miyetsuko whispered behind her fan, her eyes scanning the VIP box above the pit. "Dogs waiting for a bone."</p>
<p>“看他们，”美悦子在扇子后低语，眼睛扫视着斗兽场上方的VIP包厢。“一群等着骨头的狗。”</p>
<p>"Don't get bitten," Chen Mo murmured, his hand hovering near his waist.</p>
<p>“别被咬了，”陈默低语，手悬在腰间。</p>
<p>"I don't get bitten, Chen," she snapped the fan shut. "I break teeth."</p>
<p>“我不会被咬，陈，”她合上扇子。“我会敲碎他们的牙。”</p></div>
