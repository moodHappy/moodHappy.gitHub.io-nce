<p>第九章：幽灵的歉意</p>
<p>Ten minutes later. The pit was closed. The floor was washed. The DJ started the music again. The party resumed as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>十分钟后。坑被关上了。地板被冲洗干净。DJ重新开始了音乐。派对继续，仿佛什么都没发生过。</p>
<p>"My apologies, Mrs. Tanaka," Fantasma walked over, wiping a speck of blood from his white shoe. "A little... pest control problem. I hope it didn't ruin your evening."</p>
<p>“非常抱歉，田中太太，”幽灵走过来，擦掉白鞋上的一点血迹。“一点小小的……害虫控制问题。希望没有毁了您的夜晚。”</p>
<p>"On the contrary," Miyetsuko turned to him. Her face was flushed, her eyes glistening with a dangerous, wet sheen. She looked like she was running a high fever. "It was... stimulating."</p>
<p>“恰恰相反，”美悦子转向他。她脸颊潮红，眼睛里闪烁着危险的、湿润的光泽。她看起来像是发了高烧。“这非常……刺激。”</p>
<p>Fantasma looked at her, then at Chen Mo. He saw the way Miyetsuko was leaning against Chen Mo, her body practically vibrating. He laughed, understanding immediately.</p>
<p>幽灵看了看她，又看了看陈默。他看到了美悦子靠在陈默身上的样子，她的身体几乎在震动。他大笑，立刻明白了。</p>
<p>"Ah. I see. The adrenaline," he winked. "You need to... release it."</p>
<p>“啊。我懂了。肾上腺素，”他眨了眨眼。“你们需要……释放一下。”</p>
<p>He snapped his fingers. A bodyguard handed him a gold key card.</p>
<p>他打了个响指。保镖递给他一张金色的房卡。</p>
<p>"Top floor. The 'Emperor Suite'. Soundproof. Bulletproof. And the bed... it floats on water. My personal favorite. Consider it a gift for the inconvenience."</p>
<p>“顶层。‘帝王套房’。隔音。防弹。而且那张床……是漂在水上的。我个人的最爱。当作是对刚才不便的赔礼。”</p>
<p>"Thank you," Miyetsuko took the card. Her fingers brushed Fantasma's hand, leaving a trail of heat.</p>
<p>“谢谢，”美悦子接过卡。手指擦过幽灵的手，留下一道热度。</p>
<p>She turned to Chen Mo, grabbing his tie and pulling him towards the elevator. She didn't say a word, but her eyes screamed: Now.</p>
<p>她转向陈默，抓住他的领带，拉着他走向电梯。她一句话没说，但她的眼神在尖叫：现在。</p></div>
