<p>第六十二章：纸鹤</p>
<p>Tokyo Detention House. Sector 4. Cell 402.</p>
<p>东京拘留所。第四区。402号牢房。</p>
<p>Kurosaki Soichiro looked like a ghost of his former self. His hair was grey, unkempt. His eyes were sunken.</p>
<p>黑崎宗一郎看起来像过去的幽灵。头发灰白、凌乱。眼窝深陷。</p>
<p>"Medication time," the guard buzzed the door open.</p>
<p>“吃药时间，”警卫嗡的一声打开门。</p>
<p>Dr. Sato walked in, flanked by two guards. He checked Kurosaki's pulse. It was erratic.</p>
<p>佐藤医生走进来，两边跟着两个警卫。他检查黑崎的脉搏。很不稳定。</p>
<p>"BP is 160 over 100," Sato muttered. He reached into his pocket. "Take this. New beta-blocker."</p>
<p>“血压160/100，”佐藤低语。他伸手进口袋。“吃这个。新的β受体阻滞剂。”</p>
<p>He handed Kurosaki the white capsule.</p>
<p>他把那颗白色胶囊递给黑崎。</p>
<p>As he did, he leaned close, pretending to check Kurosaki's eyes.</p>
<p>与此同时，他凑近，假装检查黑崎的眼睛。</p>
<p>"Do not swallow," Sato whispered, his voice barely audible. "Open it. Tonight. Or Mishima kills you."</p>
<p>“别吞，”佐藤耳语，声音几乎听不见。“打开它。今晚。否则三岛会杀了你。”</p>
<p>Kurosaki froze. His survival instinct kicked in. He palmed the pill, pretending to swallow it with a gulp of water. He opened his mouth to show the guards it was gone.</p>
<p>黑崎僵住了。求生本能启动。他把药藏在手心，假装用水吞了下去。他张开嘴给警卫看药没了。</p>
<p>The door slammed shut. Darkness returned.</p>
<p>门砰地关上。黑暗回归。</p>
<p>Kurosaki waited for an hour, until the lights dimmed for the night cycle.</p>
<p>黑崎等了一个小时，直到夜间灯光变暗。</p>
<p>He curled up on his bunk, facing the wall. With trembling fingers, he pulled the capsule from under his tongue. He twisted it open.</p>
<p>他蜷缩在铺位上，面朝墙壁。用颤抖的手指从舌下拿出胶囊。拧开。</p>
<p>There was no powder inside. Just a tightly rolled strip of rice paper.</p>
<p>里面没有药粉。只有一张卷得很紧的米纸。</p>
<p>He unrolled it. The text was microscopic, written in a code he recognized—the old Kurosaki Heavy Industries emergency cipher.</p>
<p>他展开它。上面的字微乎其微，是用他认得的代码写的——旧黑崎重工的紧急密码。</p>
<p>*"Mishima has bought the night shift guards. Suicide order issued for 04:00.</p>
<p>We have hacked the security grid.</p>
<p>At 03:00, the magnetic lock on your cell will fail for 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Corridor B camera loop: Frozen.</p>
<p>Service Elevator 2: Waiting.</p>
<p>Run to the roof. Extraction team inbound.</p>
<p>* The Loyalists"*</p>
<p>“三岛买通了夜班警卫。自杀命令定于04:00执行。</p>
<p>我们黑入了安保网络。</p>
<p>03:00，你牢房的磁力锁会失效60秒。</p>
<p>B走廊摄像头循环：已冻结。</p>
<p>2号服务电梯：等待中。</p>
<p>跑向屋顶。撤离小组正在进入。</p>
<p>——死忠派”</p>
<p>Kurosaki stared at the paper. Tears welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>黑崎盯着纸条。泪水涌上眼眶。</p>
<p>"They haven't forgotten me," he whispered. "I still have power."</p>
<p>“他们没忘记我，”他低语。“我还有权力。”</p>
<p>He ate the paper. It dissolved instantly on his tongue. It tasted like hope.</p>
<p>他吃掉了纸条。它在他舌尖瞬间溶解。尝起来像希望。</p></div>
