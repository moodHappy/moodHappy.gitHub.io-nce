<p>Chapter 1: The Salt and the Silk</p>
<p>第一章：盐与丝绸</p>
<p>The Pacific sun at Tijuana was a different beast than the humid heat of the Mekong. It was dry, golden, and smelled of salt and luxury.</p>
<p>蒂华纳的太平洋阳光与湄公河那潮湿的热气截然不同。这里的阳光干燥、金黄，带着盐分与奢华的味道。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko lay on a white leather sun lounger on a private terrace overlooking the turquoise surf.</p>
<p>美悦子躺在俯瞰青绿色海浪的私人露台白皮躺椅上。</p>
<p>She wore a wide-brimmed straw hat and a bikini of sheer white lace, a stark, innocent contrast to the dark empire she had just finished dismantling in Tokyo.</p>
<p>她戴着一顶宽檐草帽，穿着一身纯白蕾丝比基尼，这身圣洁无邪的装扮与她刚刚在东京亲手拆解的黑暗帝国形成了鲜明的对比。</p>
<p>On the low table beside her sat a chilled Margarita, its rim encrusted with sea salt that sparkled like diamonds.</p>
<p>身旁的矮桌上放着一杯冰镇玛格丽特，杯缘挂着的海盐像钻石一样闪闪发光。</p>
<p>"The defectors are lining up, Miyetsuko," Chen Mo said, walking out from the shade of the villa.</p>
<p>“背叛者们正在排队投诚，美悦子，”陈默从别墅的阴影中走出来说道。</p>
<p>He was dressed in a linen shirt, unbuttoned to reveal his scarred chest, looking less like a killer and more like a high-end tourist.</p>
<p>他穿着一件亚麻衬衫，扣子散开，露出满是伤痕的胸膛，看起来不像个杀手，倒更像是个高端游客。</p>
<p>He held a tablet that displayed the crumbling hierarchy of the Mishima Group—former allies now begging for a seat at the Shadow Network’s table.</p>
<p>他手里拿着平板电脑，上面显示着三岛集团分崩离析的权力架构——那些昔日的盟友，如今正哀求着在暗影网络的桌前占有一席之地。</p>
<p>"Let them wait," Miyetsuko murmured, sliding her sunglasses down her nose to look at him.</p>
<p>“让他们等着吧，”美悦子呢喃着，将墨镜顺着鼻梁往下拉了拉，看向他。</p>
<p>"The world is finally quiet, Chen. For the first time in my life, the air doesn't taste like gunpowder."</p>
<p>“世界终于清静了，陈。我这辈子还是第一次感觉到，空气里没有火药的味道。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo sat on the edge of her lounger, his hand sliding over her sun-warmed thigh, his fingers tracing the faint, silver line of an old scar.</p>
<p>陈默坐在她的躺椅边，手滑过她被阳光晒得温热的大腿，手指勾勒着一道陈旧伤疤留下的淡银色痕迹。</p>
<p>"You earned this silence," he whispered, his eyes softening as they settled on her.</p>
<p>“这份寂静是你应得的，”他低声说道，目光落在她身上时变得柔和。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko sat up, the lace shifting over her heavy, soft breasts, her skin glowing with expensive tanning oil.</p>
<p>美悦子坐起身，蕾丝在她沉重而柔软的乳房上滑动，皮肤在昂贵防晒油的浸润下闪闪发光。</p>
<p>She reached out and took a sip of the drink, the salt stinging her lips in a way that felt like a kiss from the ocean.</p>
<p>她伸出手啜了一口酒，海盐刺痛着她的双唇，感觉就像大海的一个吻。</p>
<p>"Mishima is a memory, and Tokyo is a graveyard," she said, her voice a purr of contentment.</p>
<p>“三岛已成往事，东京已成坟场，”她说道，声音里透着心满意足的轻颤。</p>
<p>"Tonight, I don't want to talk about servers, or snipers, or bank accounts."</p>
<p>“今晚，我不想谈论服务器、狙击手或银行账户。”</p>
<p>She pulled him toward her, the scent of jasmine and lime swirling between them, the holiday vibe thick and intoxicating.</p>
<p>她将他拉向自己，茉莉与青柠的香气在两人之间盘旋，度假的气息浓郁而令人陶醉。</p>
<p>"Tonight, I want to see if the legendary 'Knight' knows how to dance in the Mexican moonlight."</p>
<p>“今晚，我想看看传说中的‘骑士’，是否懂得如何在墨西哥的月光下起舞。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo smiled—a rare, genuine expression—and pulled her into a kiss that tasted of salt and freedom.</p>
<p>陈默笑了——这是一个罕见且真诚的表情——他将她拉入一个带着盐分与自由味道的吻中。</p>
<p>Outside, the waves crashed rhythmically against the golden sand, a peaceful symphony for a Queen who had finally found her peace.</p>
<p>窗外，海浪有节奏地拍打着金色的沙滩，为这位终于寻得安宁的女王演奏着和平的交响乐。</p>
<p>But even in the paradise of Tijuana, the Shadow Network was watching. And far to the east, the dust of Juarez was beginning to stir.</p>
<p>但即使是在蒂华纳的天堂里，暗影网络依然在注视着。而在遥远的东方，华雷斯城的尘埃已开始骚动。</p>
