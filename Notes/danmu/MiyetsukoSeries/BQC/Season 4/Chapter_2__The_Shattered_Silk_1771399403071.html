<p>Chapter 2: The Shattered Silk</p>
<p>第二章：破碎的丝绸</p>
<p>The luxury mall in Tijuana was a cathedral of glass and excess, where the smell of expensive leather mingled with the heavy scent of desert blooms.</p>
<p>蒂华纳的豪华商场是一座由玻璃与放纵构筑的大教堂，昂贵皮革的味道与热带花卉浓郁的香气交织在一起。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko moved through the boutiques like a predatory swan, her credit cards—forged from the ruins of Mishima’s accounts—leaving a trail of digital fire behind her.</p>
<p>美悦子像一只掠食的天鹅般穿梭于精品店之间，她那张由三岛账户残骸伪造而成的信用卡，在身后留下一道数字火光。</p>
<p>"Try this, Chen," she whispered, stepping into a private VIP fitting room of a high-end lingerie boutique.</p>
<p>“试试这个，陈，”她轻声说道，步入一家高端内衣店的私人VIP试衣间。</p>
<p>She held a slip of midnight-blue silk, so thin it felt like a breath of wind.</p>
<p>她手里拿着一件午夜蓝的丝绸内衣，薄得仿佛一阵微风。</p>
<p>Inside the mirrored cubicle, the air was cool and smelled of her jasmine perfume. Chen Mo closed the heavy velvet curtain, isolating them from the world of shoppers and security.</p>
<p>镜面环绕的隔间内空气凉爽，透着她那茉莉香水的味道。陈默拉上沉重的丝绒帘子，将他们与充满顾客与安保的世界隔绝开来。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko turned her back to him, the zipper of her sundress sliding down with a soft, metallic hiss.</p>
<p>美悦子背对着他，太阳裙的拉链随着一声轻微的金属摩擦声滑落。</p>
<p>Her skin was pale and radiant in the dim light, the marks of the jungle fading but still visible like ghosts under the surface.</p>
<p>在昏暗的灯光下，她的皮肤白皙而有光泽，丛林留下的印记虽在消退，却仍如皮肤下的幽灵般若隐若现。</p>
<p>Chen Mo’s hands, calloused and steady, found her waist. He pulled her back against his chest, his breath hot against her neck.</p>
<p>陈默那长满老茧且稳健的双手扶住了她的腰。他将她拉回怀中抵在胸口，热辣的呼吸喷在她的颈间。</p>
<p>"You look like a dream that hasn't been paid for yet," he murmured, his fingers sliding beneath the fallen straps.</p>
<p>“你看起来像一个还未被支付的梦境，”他低声呢喃，手指滑入滑落的肩带之下。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko leaned her head back, her eyes closing as she felt the familiar electric pulse of his proximity. She turned in his arms, her hands finding the hard lines of his jaw, her lips inches from his.</p>
<p>美悦子向后仰起头，感受到他靠近时熟悉的电流感，双眼微微闭合。她在他的双臂中转过身，双手抚过他坚硬的下颌线，嘴唇离他近在咫尺。</p>
<p>The intimacy was a slow, pulsing rhythm, a moment of rare sanctuary where she wasn't a Queen and he wasn't a Knight.</p>
<p>这份亲昵是一种缓慢而搏动的节奏，是在这难得的避风港中，她不再是女王，而他不再是骑士的瞬间。</p>
<p>Then, the world shattered.</p>
<p>随后，世界破碎了。</p>
<p>RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!</p>
<p>哒哒哒哒！</p>
<p>The staccato roar of an AK-47 tore through the mall’s peaceful soundtrack, followed by the crystalline scream of the massive glass skylight imploding.</p>
<p>AK-47断断续续的咆哮声撕碎了商场宁静的背景音，紧接着是巨大的玻璃天窗炸裂时发出的清脆尖叫。</p>
<p>Screams erupted from the corridor outside—the raw, jagged panic of ordinary people caught in a cartel crossfire.</p>
<p>走廊外爆发出一阵尖叫——那是普通人陷入卡特尔交火时发出的原始而破碎的惊恐。</p>
<p>Chen Mo was moving before the first casing hit the floor. In one fluid motion, he shoved Miyetsuko to the ground and shielded her body with his own, his hand reaching for the concealed pistol at the small of his back.</p>
<p>在第一个弹壳落地前，陈默就动了。他以一个流畅的动作将美悦子护在身下，同时伸手去摸后腰隐藏的手枪。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko lay on the plush carpet, her midnight-blue silk dress half-on, her eyes wide not with fear, but with a cold, rising fury.</p>
<p>美悦子躺在豪华的地毯上，午夜蓝的丝裙只穿了一半，她的双眼圆睁，那里面不是恐惧，而是一股冷酷、正在升腾的愤怒。</p>
<p>"Amateurs," she hissed, the word a venomous curse.</p>
<p>“一群业余的小丑，”她嘶声说道，每一个字都像恶毒的诅咒。</p>
<p>She sat up, ignoring the dust falling from the ceiling, and looked at her ruined shopping bags, now covered in shards of glass.</p>
<p>她坐起身，无视从天花板飘落的尘土，看着她那如今落满玻璃碎片的购物袋。</p>
<p>Her peace had been interrupted. Her sanctuary had been violated.</p>
<p>她的安宁被打破了。她的圣殿被侵犯了。</p>
<p>"Chen," she said, her voice dropping to a terrifying, quiet calm as she reached for the Golden Derringer hidden in her discarded sundress.</p>
<p>“陈，”在伸手去拿掉落在太阳裙里的金色德林加时，她的声音降到了一种令人恐惧、寂静的冷静。</p>
<p>"Find out which local dog is barking in my backyard."</p>
<p>“查清楚是哪条当地的野狗在我的后院乱叫。”</p>
<p>"And remind them that the Queen does not like to be disturbed while she is shopping."</p>
<p>“然后提醒他们，女王在购物的时候，不喜欢被打扰。”</p>
<p>Would you like to move to Chapter 3, where Chen Mo navigates the chaotic mall to eliminate the shooters while Miyetsuko waits in the wreckage, planning her takeover of the Tijuana underworld?</p>
<p>是否继续 第三章：陈默穿梭在混乱的商场中清理枪手，而美悦子在残骸中等待，并开始策划接收蒂华纳的地下世界？</p>
