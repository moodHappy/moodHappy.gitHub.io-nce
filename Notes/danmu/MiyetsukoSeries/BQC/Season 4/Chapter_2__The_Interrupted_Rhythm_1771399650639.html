<p>Chapter 2: The Interrupted Rhythm</p>
<p>第二章：被打断的律动</p>
<p>The shopping mall in Tijuana was a cathedral of glass and excess, a place where the scent of expensive leather fought with the aroma of roasted agave.</p>
<p>蒂华纳的购物商场是一座由玻璃与过度消费构成的教堂，昂贵皮革的气味与烤龙舌兰的香气在此搏杀。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko moved through the boutiques like a predatory ghost, her shopping bags carried by a stoic Chen Mo.</p>
<p>美悦子像幽灵般穿梭于各家精品店，陈默面无表情地拎着购物袋跟在身后。</p>
<p>She stopped at a high-end lingerie shop, picking out a set of emerald green silk that matched the dark fire in her eyes.</p>
<p>她在一家高端内衣店停下，挑了一套翠绿色的丝绸内衣，那颜色正配她眼中暗藏的火光。</p>
<p>"Try it on," she whispered to Chen Mo, though the command was for him to follow her into the oversized fitting room.</p>
<p>“试试看，”她对陈默低声说道，但这命令其实是让他跟着她走进那间宽大的试衣间。</p>
<p>Inside, the air was cool and smelled of jasmine. The heavy velvet curtain muffled the sounds of the outside world.</p>
<p>试衣间内空气凉爽，透着茉莉香。沉重的丝绒帘幕隔绝了外界的喧嚣。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stepped out of her sundress, her skin glowing like moonlight against the dark interior.</p>
<p>美悦子脱掉太阳裙，她的肌肤在暗沉的室内散发着如月光般的光泽。</p>
<p>She leaned back against the cold mirror, her large, heavy breasts swaying slightly as she guided Chen Mo’s hands to her waist.</p>
<p>她向后靠在冰冷的镜面上，当她引导陈默的手落向自己的腰间时，沉重而巨大的乳房微微晃动。</p>
<p>The contrast was striking: his scarred, calloused palms against the impossible softness of her silk-clad curves.</p>
<p>对比极具视觉冲击力：他那满是伤痕、布满老茧的手掌，正贴在她那覆着丝绸、软到不可思议的曲线上。</p>
<p>Chen Mo breathed in the scent of her hair, his body a hard, grounding weight against hers.</p>
<p>陈默吸入她发间的香气，身体化作沉稳而坚硬的重量抵着她。</p>
<p>He lifted her, her legs wrapping around his hips, the green silk shifting and stretching as the tension in the room reached a breaking point.</p>
<p>他将她抱起，她的双腿缠上他的胯骨，随着室内的张力达到临界点，翠绿色的丝绸在滑动中被撑紧。</p>
<p>Just as the world narrowed down to the heat of their shared breath, and Chen was a heartbeat away from entering her—</p>
<p>就在世界缩小到只剩下两人交叠的呼吸，陈默离进入她仅剩一个心跳的瞬间——</p>
<p>STACCATO GUNFIRE.</p>
<p>连串的枪声响起。</p>
<p>The heavy plate glass of the storefront shattered, the sound of a thousand crystal bells screaming in the hallway outside.</p>
<p>店面的厚平板玻璃碎裂开来，数千只水晶铃铛般的尖啸声在门外的走廊回荡。</p>
<p>Screams replaced the ambient music, followed by the rhythmic thud-thud-thud of submachine guns.</p>
<p>尖叫声取代了背景音乐，紧接着是冲锋枪有节奏的“哒哒哒”声。</p>
<p>Chen Mo reacted instantly, shielding Miyetsuko’s body with his own and dropping to the floor, his hand already reaching for the concealed pistol in his waistband.</p>
<p>陈默反应迅速，用身体护住美悦子顺势伏倒在地，手已伸向腰间隐藏的手枪。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko lay beneath him, her emerald silk torn, her heart hammering not with fear, but with a cold, jagged fury.</p>
<p>美悦子躺在他身下，翠绿丝绸被扯坏了，她的心脏剧烈跳动，那不是因为恐惧，而是一种冰冷而参差的愤怒。</p>
<p>"In the middle of my climax?" she hissed, her eyes turning into two shards of black glass.</p>
<p>“在我高潮的关头？”她嘶声说道，双眼变成了两枚黑色玻璃碎片。</p>
<p>She reached for her white lace sundress, pulling the Golden Derringer from its hidden pocket before she even bothered to fix her bra.</p>
<p>她够向那件白色蕾丝裙，甚至懒得去整理胸罩，就先从隐蔽口袋里拔出了那把金色德林加。</p>
<p>"This isn't a gang war, Chen," she spat, wiping a stray smudge of lipstick from her chin.</p>
<p>“这不只是一场帮派枪战，陈，”她啐了一口，擦掉下巴上的一抹残红。</p>
<p>"This is an interruption. And I don't like being interrupted."</p>
<p>“这是在扫兴。而我不喜欢扫兴。”</p>
<p>She stood up, ignoring the chaos outside the curtain, the small gilded gun looking like a toy in her hand—until she clicked the safety off.</p>
<p>她站起身，无视帘外的混乱，那把精巧的镀金手枪握在手里像个玩具——直到她拨开了保险。</p>
<p>"Let's go kill whoever thinks their petty turf war is more important than my afternoon."</p>
<p>“走，去把那些觉得地盘争夺比我的下午更重要的家伙全杀了。”</p>
