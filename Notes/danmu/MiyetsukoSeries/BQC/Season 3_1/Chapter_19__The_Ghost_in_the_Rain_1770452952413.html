<p>第十九章：雨中的幽灵</p>
<p>Ten minutes later. The back alley of the Logistics Center.</p>
<p>十分钟后。物流中心的后巷。</p>
<p>A garbage chute opened, and a figure covered in filth and grease slid out, crashing heavily into a pile of wet cardboard boxes.</p>
<p>一个垃圾滑道打开，一个满身污秽和油污的人影滑了出来，重重地摔在湿漉漉的纸箱堆里。</p>
<p>Chen Mo lay in the mud, letting the heavy rain wash over his face. He gasped for air, his lungs burning like fire, while his skin was freezing cold.</p>
<p>陈默躺在泥水里，任由暴雨冲刷着他的脸。他大口喘息，肺部像火烧一样疼，皮肤却冷得刺骨。</p>
<p>He was alive.</p>
<p>他活着。</p>
<p>He spat out the USB drive from his mouth. It was covered in his blood—he had bitten his tongue when he fell.</p>
<p>他吐出了嘴里的U盘。上面沾满了他自己的血——刚才摔下来时咬破了舌头。</p>
<p>He took out the waterproof phone he had prepared. The screen was cracked, but it still worked.</p>
<p>他掏出那部早就准备好的防水手机。屏幕裂了，但还能用。</p>
<p>There was one missed call. From an unknown number.</p>
<p>有一个未接来电。来自未知号码。</p>
<p>Chen Mo stared at the number, his eyes cold and terrifying, like a wolf that had just crawled out of hell. He dialed back.</p>
<p>陈默盯着那个号码，眼神冷厉得可怕，像一头刚从地狱爬出来的狼。他拨了回去。</p>
<p>"Beep... Beep..."</p>
<p>“嘟……嘟……”</p>
<p>"Hello?" Miyetsuko's voice came through. She sounded surprised. "You... you're still alive?"</p>
<p>“喂？”美悦子的声音传来。带着一丝惊讶。“你……你还活着？”</p>
<p>"Disappointed?" Chen Mo's voice was hoarse, sounding like scraping sandpaper.</p>
<p>“很失望吗？”陈默的声音沙哑，像砂纸摩擦一样。</p>
<p>"I'm surprised." She paused. "But it doesn't matter. You escaped, but you have nothing. The server has been wiped. I saw the logs remotely. Kurosaki destroyed everything to cover up the scandal. I won. He lost his leverage."</p>
<p>“我很意外。”她停顿了一下。“但这不重要了。你逃出来了，但你一无所有。服务器已经被清洗了。我远程看到了日志。黑崎为了掩盖丑闻，销毁了一切。我赢了。他失去了他的把柄。”</p>
<p>"You won?" Chen Mo laughed, a low, menacing laugh in the rain.</p>
<p>“你赢了？”陈默在雨中发出一声低沉阴森的笑。</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at?" Miyetsuko's tone suddenly became uneasy.</p>
<p>“你笑什么？”美悦子的语气突然变得不安。</p>
<p>"You think you used me to burn the house down. But you forgot, I'm the one who carried the firewood."</p>
<p>“你以为你利用我烧掉了房子。但你忘了，我是那个搬柴火的人。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo held the USB drive tightly in his hand, the sharp corner piercing his palm.</p>
<p>陈默紧紧捏着手里的U盘，棱角刺破了手掌。</p>
<p>"I have a backup, Miyetsuko. The real list. The one you wanted to destroy, and the one he wanted to hide. It's all in my hand."</p>
<p>“我有备份，美悦子。真正的名单。那份你想销毁的，和他想隐藏的。全都在我手里。”</p>
<p>Silence. Deathly silence on the other end of the phone.</p>
<p>沉默。电话那头死一般的沉默。</p>
<p>"Now," Chen Mo stood up, staggering towards the lights of the distant city. "The game has changed. I am no longer the pawn."</p>
<p>“现在，”陈默站起来，跌跌撞撞地走向远处城市的灯火。“游戏规则变了。我不再是棋子了。”</p>
<p>"Come and find me. Or... I will send this list to everyone. Your husband's enemies, the police, the CIA... and your husband."</p>
<p>“来找我。或者……我把这份名单发给所有人。你丈夫的仇家、警察、CIA……还有你的丈夫。”</p>
<p>"Chen Mo, don't be stupid..." Her voice finally showed a trace of panic.</p>
<p>“陈默，别做傻事……”她的声音终于带上了一丝慌乱。</p>
<p>"Bring cash. Bring a car. And bring your sincere body." Chen Mo hung up the phone.</p>
<p>“带上现金。带上车。带上你诚实的身体。”陈默挂断了电话。</p>
<p>He threw the phone into the sewer.</p>
<p>他把手机扔进了下水道。</p>
<p>The rain stopped.</p>
<p>雨停了。</p>
<p>The hunter has become the hunted. And the prey has just grown fangs.</p>
<p>猎人变成了猎物。而猎物，刚刚长出了獠牙。</p></div>
