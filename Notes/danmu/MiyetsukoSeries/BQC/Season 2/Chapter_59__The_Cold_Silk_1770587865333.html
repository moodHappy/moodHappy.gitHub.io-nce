<p>第五十九章：冷丝绸</p>
<p>She pushed the velvet dress off her shoulders. It fell to the floor with a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>她把天鹅绒裙子推下肩膀。裙子伴着一声沉重的叹息落在那地板上。</p>
<p>Underneath, she wore nothing but the black choker with the ruby. Her skin, still holding the warmth of the Brazilian sun, looked startling against the austere Japanese minimalism of the room.</p>
<p>在下面，她只戴着那条红宝石颈圈。她的皮肤还保留着巴西阳光的温度，在房间极简主义的日式冷峻中显得惊心动魄。</p>
<p>"Rio was hot," she murmured, stepping closer to him. "Tokyo is cold. I need heat, Chen."</p>
<p>“里约很热，”她喃喃着，向他靠近。“东京很冷。我需要热量，陈。”</p>
<p>She didn't wait for him. She unbuttoned his shirt, sliding her hands inside to feel his chest. Her fingers were cold, sending shivers down his spine.</p>
<p>她没等他。她解开他的衬衫，手滑进去抚摸他的胸膛。她的手指是冰凉的，让他脊背发颤。</p>
<p>"You bought a company today," Chen Mo's voice was rough. "Aren't you tired?"</p>
<p>“你今天买了一家公司，”陈默的声音沙哑。“你不累吗？”</p>
<p>"Power is an aphrodisiac," she bit his lower lip. "And revenge... is foreplay."</p>
<p>“权力是春药，”她咬住他的下唇。“而复仇……是前戏。”</p>
<p>She pushed him onto the low, wide bed. The sheets were crisp, high-thread-count cotton.</p>
<p>她把他推倒在那张低矮宽大的床上。床单是清脆的高支棉。</p>
<p>This wasn't the desperate, survival sex of the jungle. This was refined. Calculated. Every touch was a statement of luxury and ownership.</p>
<p>这不是丛林里那种绝望的、为了生存的性爱。这是精致的。经过计算的。每一次触碰都是对奢华和所有权的声明。</p>
<p>She straddled him, her back arched, the city lights framing her silhouette. She looked like a deity demanding worship.</p>
<p>她跨坐在他身上，背脊弓起，城市灯光勾勒出她的剪影。她看起来像一位索求崇拜的神祇。</p>
<p>"Mishima thinks he can trap me," she whispered, moving slowly against him. "But he doesn't know what I learned in the dark."</p>
<p>“三岛以为他能困住我，”她低语，在他身上缓慢移动。“但他不知道我在黑暗中学到了什么。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo reached up, his hands cupping her face. He looked into her eyes—eyes that had seen murder and madness.</p>
<p>陈默伸出手，捧住她的脸。他看着她的眼睛——那双见过谋杀和疯狂的眼睛。</p>
<p>"We will burn his web," he promised. "Strand by strand."</p>
<p>“我们会烧了他的网，”他承诺。“一根一根地烧。”</p>
<p>"Starting with Kurosaki," she leaned down, kissing him deeply. "The spider sits in the center. In the prison."</p>
<p>“从黑崎开始，”她俯身，深吻他。“蜘蛛坐在网中央。在监狱里。”</p></div>
