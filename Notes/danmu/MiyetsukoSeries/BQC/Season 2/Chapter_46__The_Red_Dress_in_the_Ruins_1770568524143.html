<p>第四十六章：废墟中的红裙</p>
<p>The Old Jesuit Ruins. A roofless stone church swallowed by the jungle. Vines strangled the altar, and sunlight pierced through the broken arches like spears.</p>
<p>旧耶稣会遗址。一座被丛林吞噬的无顶石教堂。藤蔓勒死了祭坛，阳光像长矛一样穿过破碎的拱门。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stood in the center of the nave.</p>
<p>美悦子站在中殿中央。</p>
<p>She wasn't wearing tactical gear anymore. She had salvaged a dress from her emergency bag—a simple, blood-red slip dress. It was torn at the hem, stained with mud, and clung to her body with sweat.</p>
<p>她不再穿战术装备了。她从应急包里翻出一条裙子——一条简单的、血红色的吊带裙。裙摆撕裂，沾满泥土，被汗水粘在身上。</p>
<p>She looked like a sacrificial lamb. Or a fallen angel.</p>
<p>她看起来像只待宰的羔羊。或者一个堕落天使。</p>
<p>"How do I look?" she asked into the hidden earpiece.</p>
<p>“我看起来怎么样？”她对着隐藏耳机问。</p>
<p>"Like a trap," Chen Mo's voice came from above. He was perched high in the bell tower, concealed by ivy, looking through the scope of a sniper rifle.</p>
<p>“像个陷阱，”陈默的声音从上方传来。他栖身在高高的钟楼里，被常春藤遮蔽，通过狙击步枪的瞄准镜看着。</p>
<p>"Good," she smiled, running her hands over her hips. Under the thin red silk, taped to her inner thigh, was a ceramic knife. "Keep your eyes on me, Chen. Don't look at the jungle. Look at me."</p>
<p>“很好，”她笑了，双手抚过臀部。在薄薄的红丝绸下，大腿内侧贴着一把陶瓷刀。“看着我，陈。别看丛林。看着我。”</p>
<p>"I never look anywhere else," Chen Mo adjusted his scope. The crosshairs settled on the curve of her neck, then moved to the entrance of the ruins.</p>
<p>“我从不看别处，”陈默调整瞄准镜。十字准星停在她脖颈的弧线上，然后移向废墟入口。</p>
<p>The ground began to vibrate. Dust fell from the arches.</p>
<p>地面开始震动。灰尘从拱门落下。</p>
<p>They were here.</p>
<p>他们来了。</p></div>
