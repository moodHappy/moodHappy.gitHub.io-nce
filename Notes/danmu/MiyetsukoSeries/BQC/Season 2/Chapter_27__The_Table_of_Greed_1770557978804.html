<p>第二十七章：贪婪的赌桌</p>
<p>The VIP box was a cloud of smoke. Fantasma sat at the head of a mahogany table. To his left was "El Carnicero" (The Butcher), a Colombian cartel boss with gold teeth. To his right was Nikolai, a Russian arms dealer with dead eyes.</p>
<p>VIP包厢是一团烟雾。幽灵坐在红木桌的首位。他的左边是“屠夫”，一个满口金牙的哥伦比亚毒枭。右边是尼古拉，一个眼神死寂的俄罗斯军火商。</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," Fantasma stood up, acting the gracious host. "Meet the key to the city. Mrs. Tanaka."</p>
<p>“先生们，”幽灵站起来，扮演着好客的主人。“见见这把城市的钥匙。田中太太。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko didn't sit immediately. She walked to the edge of the glass, looking down at the bloody fight below. The light from the arena backlit her Qipao, turning the silhouette of her body into a dangerous curve against the glass.</p>
<p>美悦子没有立刻坐下。她走到玻璃边缘，俯视下方血腥的格斗。竞技场的灯光从背后照亮了她的旗袍，将她的身体剪影成一道危险的曲线映在玻璃上。</p>
<p>"Impressive zoo you have here," she turned, her movements slow, deliberate.</p>
<p>“你的动物园令人印象深刻，”她转身，动作缓慢、刻意。</p>
<p>"The Butcher" leaned back, his eyes glued to the slit in her dress.</p>
<p>“屠夫”向后靠去，眼睛死死盯着她裙子的开叉。</p>
<p>"Pretty key," The Butcher spat on the floor. "But does she fit the lock? Or is she just for decoration?"</p>
<p>“漂亮的钥匙，”屠夫往地上啐了一口。“但她能插进锁孔吗？还是只是个装饰品？”</p>
<p>He slammed a heavy knife onto the table.</p>
<p>他把一把沉重的刀拍在桌子上。</p>
<p>"I hear you have the port codes. I want them. Name your price, puta (bitch)."</p>
<p>“听说你有港口代码。我要了。开个价，婊子。”</p>
<p>The air froze. Fantasma stopped smiling. Even the Russian looked up.</p>
<p>空气凝固了。幽灵停止了微笑。连那个俄罗斯人都抬起了头。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko didn't flinch. She smiled. A smile that was sweeter than honey and colder than liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>美悦子没有退缩。她笑了。一个比蜂蜜还甜，比液氮还冷的笑。</p>
<p>She walked over to the table. She didn't sit in the empty chair. Instead, she sat on the armrest of Chen Mo's chair—who had remained standing—forcing him to sit down so she could perch on him.</p>
<p>她走到桌边。她没有坐那把空椅子。相反，她坐在了陈默椅子的扶手上——陈默一直站着——她强迫他坐下，好让自己能栖息在他身上。</p>
<p>She placed a hand on Chen Mo's shoulder, her fingers idly playing with his collar. It was a display of ownership. This is my man. And you are nothing.</p>
<p>她把一只手搭在陈默肩上，手指漫不经心地玩弄着他的领子。这是一种所有权的展示。这是我的人。而你们什么都不是。</p>
<p>"Price?" she looked at The Butcher. "You can't afford me. But... we can play a game."</p>
<p>“价钱？”她看着屠夫。“你买不起我。不过……我们可以玩个游戏。”</p></div>
