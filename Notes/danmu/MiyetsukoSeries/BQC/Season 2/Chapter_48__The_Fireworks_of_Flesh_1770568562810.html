<p>第四十八章：血肉烟花</p>
<p>"NOW!"</p>
<p>“现在！”</p>
<p>CLICK.</p>
<p>咔哒。</p>
<p>Chen Mo pressed the detonator.</p>
<p>陈默按下了引爆器。</p>
<p>The ground beneath the trucks exploded. The C4 charges buried in the ruins' foundation detonated simultaneously.</p>
<p>卡车下方的地面炸开了。埋在废墟地基里的C4炸药同时引爆。</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>轰！</p>
<p>A wall of fire and stone erupted. The shockwave knocked the guards off their feet. The roofless church became a cauldron of dust and shrapnel.</p>
<p>一堵火墙和石块喷发而出。冲击波把卫兵掀翻在地。无顶教堂变成了灰尘和弹片的熔炉。</p>
<p>In the chaos, Miyetsuko moved.</p>
<p>在一片混乱中，美悦子动了。</p>
<p>She didn't run away. She lunged at The Butcher.</p>
<p>她没有逃跑。她扑向了屠夫。</p>
<p>Before he could draw his gun, she ripped the ceramic knife from her thigh tape.</p>
<p>在他拔枪之前，她撕下大腿胶带上的陶瓷刀。</p>
<p>SHUCK.</p>
<p>噗嗤。</p>
<p>She drove the knife into his neck. Right into the jugular.</p>
<p>她把刀扎进他的脖子。正中颈静脉。</p>
<p>The Butcher gurgled, blood spraying onto her red dress, making it glisten. He fell back onto the stone altar.</p>
<p>屠夫咯咯作响，血喷在她红裙上，让裙子闪闪发光。他向后倒在石祭坛上。</p>
<p>"My cage is bigger," she hissed into his dying face.</p>
<p>“我的笼子更大，”她对着他垂死的脸嘶声说。</p>
<p>From the bell tower, a rhythmic crack-crack-crack began. Chen Mo was picking off the confused survivors one by one. Every shot was a precise period at the end of a sentence.</p>
<p>从钟楼上，有节奏的啪-啪-啪声开始了。陈默正在一个个点名那些困惑的幸存者。每一枪都是句子末尾精准的句号。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stood over the body of The Butcher. She was bathed in blood and dust. The explosions continued around her, but she was the eye of the storm.</p>
<p>美悦子站在屠夫的尸体上。她沐浴在鲜血和灰尘中。爆炸声在她周围持续，但她是风暴眼。</p>
<p>She looked up at the bell tower. She couldn't see him, but she knew he was watching.</p>
<p>她抬头看钟楼。她看不见他，但她知道他在看。</p>
<p>She lifted her blood-soaked hem and wiped the knife clean on her thigh, deliberately exposing her leg to the scope.</p>
<p>她撩起浸透鲜血的裙摆，在大腿上擦干净刀，刻意向瞄准镜暴露着她的腿。</p>
<p>"Clear," Chen Mo's voice came through the earpiece. "Area secured."</p>
<p>“清除，”陈默的声音从耳机传来。“区域安全。”</p></div>
