<p>第四十九章：恶人的祈祷</p>
<p>Chen Mo rappelled down from the tower. He walked into the ruins.</p>
<p>陈默从塔楼索降下来。走进废墟。</p>
<p>The smell of cordite and roast pork was overwhelming.</p>
<p>柯达炸药和烤猪肉的味道令人窒息。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko was sitting on the altar, next to the corpse. She was shaking. Not from fear, but from the massive adrenaline dump.</p>
<p>美悦子坐在祭坛上，就在尸体旁边。她在发抖。不是因为恐惧，而是因为巨大的肾上腺素释放。</p>
<p>"We killed him," she said, staring at her red hands. "The Butcher is meat."</p>
<p>“我们杀了他，”她说，盯着自己红色的双手。“屠夫变成了肉。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo holstered his rifle. He walked up to the altar. He didn't look at the corpse. He looked at her.</p>
<p>陈默收起步枪。走到祭坛前。他没看尸体。他看着她。</p>
<p>Her dress was ruined. Her hair was wild. She looked terrifying. She looked magnificent.</p>
<p>她的裙子毁了。头发狂乱。她看起来很可怕。她看起来很壮丽。</p>
<p>"You are a mess," he said softly, taking a handkerchief and wiping a spot of blood from her forehead.</p>
<p>“你一团糟，”他轻声说，掏出手帕擦掉她额头的一点血迹。</p>
<p>"I'm alive," she grabbed his wrist. Her grip was iron. "Take me out of here, Chen. I want to wash this off. In the ocean."</p>
<p>“我活着，”她抓住他的手腕。抓得死紧。“带我离开这儿，陈。我要洗掉这些。在海里。”</p>
<p>"The port is still closed," Chen Mo reminded her. "Fantasma betrayed us. We have no way out."</p>
<p>“港口还关着，”陈默提醒她。“幽灵背叛了我们。我们没有出路。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko looked down at The Butcher's body. She saw his phone sticking out of his pocket.</p>
<p>美悦子低头看屠夫的尸体。她看到他的手机从口袋里露出来。</p>
<p>She smiled. A wicked, sharp smile.</p>
<p>她笑了。一个邪恶、锋利的笑。</p>
<p>"We have his phone. We have his accounts. We have his army's contacts," she picked up the phone. "The Butcher is dead. But his money isn't."</p>
<p>“我们有他的手机。有他的账户。有他军队的联系方式，”她拿起手机。“屠夫死了。但他的钱没死。”</p>
<p>She looked at Chen Mo, her eyes gleaming with a new plan.</p>
<p>她看着陈默，眼里闪烁着新计划的光芒。</p>
<p>"We don't need Fantasma's port. We are going to buy our own army. And we are going to march back into Rio not as refugees... but as the new Cartel."</p>
<p>“我们不需要幽灵的港口。我们要买下我们自己的军队。我们要杀回里约，不是作为难民……而是作为新的卡特尔。”</p>
<p>She pulled Chen Mo close, smearing blood on his tactical vest.</p>
<p>她把陈默拉近，血蹭在他的战术背心上。</p>
<p>"But first... kiss me. In front of him."</p>
<p>“但首先……吻我。在他面前。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo leaned in. He kissed her over the body of their enemy, amidst the burning ruins of the church. It was a blasphemous, holy moment.</p>
<p>陈默俯身。在敌人尸体的上方，在燃烧的教堂废墟中，吻了她。那是一个亵渎的、神圣的时刻。</p></div>
