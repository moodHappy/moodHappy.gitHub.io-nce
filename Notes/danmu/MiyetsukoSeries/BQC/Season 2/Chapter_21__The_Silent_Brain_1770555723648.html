<p>第二十一章：沉默的大脑</p>
<p>Chen Mo leaned against a stack of crates, his arms crossed. He wore a simple black shirt, sleeves rolled up to reveal his forearms. He looked unassuming, almost invisible.</p>
<p>陈默靠在一堆板条箱上，双臂交叉。他穿着简单的黑衬衫，袖子卷起露出小臂。他看起来毫不起眼，几乎是隐形的。</p>
<p>But in his hand was a ruggedized laptop. He was the one actually rewriting the port's algorithms in real-time. Miyetsuko was the face; he was the ghost in the machine.</p>
<p>但他手里拿着一台加固型笔记本电脑。实际上是他正在实时重写港口的算法。美悦子是门面；他是机器里的幽灵。</p>
<p>"Speed up the flow, Chen," Miyetsuko whispered, leaning back so her head rested against his hip. "Fantasma is getting impatient."</p>
<p>“加快流量，陈，”美悦子向后仰，把头靠在他的胯骨上，低声说。“幽灵不耐烦了。”</p>
<p>"The firewall is upgrading. Give me 30 seconds," Chen Mo didn't move away. Instead, he rested his hand on her shoulder, his thumb idly stroking her neck.</p>
<p>“防火墙正在升级。给我30秒，”陈默没有躲开。相反，他把手搭在她肩上，拇指漫不经心地抚摸着她的脖子。</p>
<p>To the onlookers, it looked like a servant attending to his mistress. But the intimacy of the touch—the way her body relaxed instantly under his hand, the way she tilted her head to press her cheek against his growing erection through his pants—told a different story.</p>
<p>在旁观者看来，这像是个仆人在伺候女主人。但这种触碰的亲密感——她在他手下瞬间放松的身体，她侧过头隔着裤子把脸颊贴在他逐渐隆起的下体上的方式——讲述着另一个故事。</p>
<p>"They think you are my pet," she murmured, her eyes half-closed, enjoying the vibration of his voice through his body.</p>
<p>“他们以为你是我的宠物，”她喃喃道，眼睛半闭，享受着他的声音通过身体传来的震动。</p>
<p>"Let them think that," Chen Mo typed a command with one hand while gripping her shoulder tighter with the other. "It makes them careless. Access Granted."</p>
<p>“让他们这么想吧，”陈默单手输入指令，另一只手更紧地抓住了她的肩膀。“这会让他们大意。访问已授权。”</p>
<p>"Good boy," she smiled, reaching up to squeeze his thigh hard. "Tonight, you can be on top."</p>
<p>“乖男孩，”她笑了，伸手用力捏了一把他的大腿。“今晚，让你在上面。”</p></div>
