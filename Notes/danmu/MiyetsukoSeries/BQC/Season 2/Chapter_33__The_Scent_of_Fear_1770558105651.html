<p>第三十三章：恐惧的气味</p>
<p>Miyetsuko dropped the phone onto the sofa. She walked to the window, staring at the sprawling favelas climbing the hills.</p>
<p>美悦子把电话扔在沙发上。她走到窗边，盯着爬满山坡的贫民窟。</p>
<p>"Fantasma sold the video," she whispered. "That snake."</p>
<p>“幽灵卖了视频，”她低语。“那条毒蛇。”</p>
<p>"He's a businessman. Loyalty has a price," Chen Mo walked up behind her. He placed his hands on her waist, pulling her back against him.</p>
<p>“他是生意人。忠诚是有价的，”陈默走到她身后。双手扶住她的腰，把她拉向自己。</p>
<p>He felt her tension. Her muscles were hard, her breathing shallow. She was scared. Not of dying, but of being captured. Of becoming Mishima's trophy.</p>
<p>他感觉到了她的紧张。她的肌肉僵硬，呼吸浅促。她在害怕。不是怕死，而是怕被捕获。怕成为三岛的战利品。</p>
<p>"I won't let him take you," Chen Mo whispered into her ear. His hands slid under her silk robe, finding the warm, soft skin of her stomach. "You belong to no one. Only yourself. And me."</p>
<p>“我不会让他带走你，”陈默在她耳边低语。他的手滑进她的丝绸睡袍，找到了她腹部温暖柔软的皮肤。“你不属于任何人。只属于你自己。和我。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko turned around in his arms. Her eyes were fierce, desperate.</p>
<p>美悦子在他怀里转过身。她的眼神凶狠、绝望。</p>
<p>"Make me believe it, Chen," she grabbed his hand and placed it on her heart. It was beating fast, like a trapped bird. "He saw the video. He saw me... with that pig. He thinks I'm dirty. He thinks he can buy me."</p>
<p>“让我相信这一点，陈，”她抓着他的手按在自己心口。心跳很快，像只被困的鸟。“他看到了视频。他看到我……和那头猪在一起。他觉得我脏。他觉得他能买下我。”</p>
<p>"He saw a weapon," Chen Mo corrected her. He leaned down and kissed her neck, right on the pulse point. "I see the Queen who wielded it."</p>
<p>“他看到的是一件武器，”陈默纠正她。他俯身吻上她的脖子，就在脉搏跳动的地方。“而我看到的是挥舞它的女王。”</p>
<p>He lifted her up, carrying her to the sofa.</p>
<p>他把她抱起来，走向沙发。</p>
<p>"We need to plan. We need weapons. We need allies," she murmured, wrapping her legs around him, her silk robe falling open completely.</p>
<p>“我们需要计划。我们需要武器。我们需要盟友，”她喃喃道，双腿缠住他，丝绸睡袍完全敞开了。</p>
<p>"Later," Chen Mo silenced her with a kiss. "Right now, you need to remember who you are. You are not a victim. You are the one who breaks fingers."</p>
<p>“待会儿再说，”陈默用吻封住了她的嘴。“现在，你需要记住你是谁。你不是受害者。你是那个折断别人手指的人。”</p>
<p>He entered her slowly, deeply, grounding her.</p>
<p>他缓慢、深入地进入了她，让她感到踏实。</p>
<p>In the face of a new war, sex was their ritual. It was how they confirmed their alliance. It was how they reminded each other that their bodies, their souls, and their sins were intertwined, and no billionaire in Tokyo could tear them apart.</p>
<p>在新的战争面前，性是他们的仪式。这是他们确认同盟的方式。这是他们提醒彼此——他们的身体、灵魂和罪孽是交织在一起的，东京的任何亿万富翁都无法将他们撕开。</p>
<p>"Friday..." she gasped, her nails digging into his shoulders. "He gave us until Friday."</p>
<p>“周五……”她喘息着，指甲掐进他的肩膀。“他给我们的期限是周五。”</p>
<p>"Then we have four days," Chen Mo moved with a steady, powerful rhythm. "To turn Rio upside down."</p>
<p>“那我们还有四天，”陈默以稳定、有力的节奏律动。“足够把里约翻个底朝天了。”</p></div>
