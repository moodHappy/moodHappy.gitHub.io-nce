<p>第六十章：死亡蓝图</p>
<p>Later that night. 3:00 AM.</p>
<p>那一夜晚些时候。凌晨3点。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko lay asleep, one arm draped over the side of the bed.</p>
<p>美悦子睡着了，一只手臂搭在床边。</p>
<p>Chen Mo was awake. He sat by the window in a silk robe, a glass of whiskey in hand. On the coffee table in front of him was a holographic blueprint projector.</p>
<p>陈默醒着。他穿着丝绸睡袍坐在窗边，手里端着一杯威士忌。面前的茶几上是一台全息蓝图投影仪。</p>
<p>It displayed the 3D layout of the Tokyo Detention House.</p>
<p>它显示着东京拘留所的3D布局图。</p>
<p>"Sector 4. Solitary Confinement," Chen Mo muttered, zooming in on a specific cell.</p>
<p>“第四区。单独监禁，”陈默低语，放大到一个特定的牢房。</p>
<p>Kurosaki was there. Waiting for trial. Or waiting for Mishima to silence him.</p>
<p>黑崎就在那里。等待审判。或者等待三岛让他闭嘴。</p>
<p>"Access points: None. Food delivery: Automated. Guards: Rotated every 4 hours."</p>
<p>“接入点：无。食物配送：自动化。警卫：每4小时轮换。”</p>
<p>It was a fortress designed to keep people in, and keep assassins out.</p>
<p>那是一座为了把人关在里面，也为了把杀手挡在外面而设计的堡垒。</p>
<p>"How do we get in?" Miyetsuko's voice came from the bed. She was awake, watching him.</p>
<p>“我们怎么进去？”美悦子的声音从床上传来。她醒了，看着他。</p>
<p>"We don't," Chen Mo didn't turn around. "We are too high profile now. If we go near that prison, Mishima will know."</p>
<p>“我们不进去，”陈默没回头。“我们现在太高调了。如果我们靠近那个监狱，三岛会知道。”</p>
<p>"Then how?" She walked over, wrapping her arms around his neck from behind, resting her chin on his shoulder. She looked at the blue hologram glowing in the dark.</p>
<p>“那怎么做？”她走过来，从背后搂住他的脖子，下巴搁在他肩上。看着黑暗中发光的蓝色全息图。</p>
<p>"We send a trojan horse," Chen Mo pointed to the infirmary section of the prison. "Kurosaki has a heart condition. He takes medication daily."</p>
<p>“我们送个特洛伊木马进去，”陈默指着监狱的医务室区域。“黑崎有心脏病。他每天都要吃药。”</p>
<p>"Poison?"</p>
<p>“毒药？”</p>
<p>"Too obvious. Mishima will test his food," Chen Mo shook his head. "No. We give him something else. Something he wants."</p>
<p>“太明显了。三岛会检测他的食物，”陈默摇头。“不。我们要给他点别的。他想要的东西。”</p>
<p>"What does a dying man want?"</p>
<p>“一个快死的人想要什么？”</p>
<p>"Hope," Chen Mo smiled coldly. "We make him believe he can escape. We send him a message. A way out."</p>
<p>“希望，”陈默冷笑。“我们要让他相信他能逃跑。给他发个信息。一条出路。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko's eyes lit up. She understood.</p>
<p>美悦子的眼睛亮了。她懂了。</p>
<p>"And when he takes the bait... when he tries to run..."</p>
<p>“当他咬钩的时候……当他试图逃跑的时候……”</p>
<p>"Mishima's guards will panic. They will shoot him. Or..." Chen Mo tapped the hologram. "Or we trigger the 'fail-safe' in the escape route."</p>
<p>“三岛的警卫会恐慌。他们会开枪。或者……”陈默敲了敲全息图。“或者我们在逃跑路线上触发‘保险丝’。”</p>
<p>"Cruel," she kissed his cheek. "Making him run towards his death, thinking it's freedom."</p>
<p>“真残忍，”她吻了吻他的脸颊。“让他奔向死亡，却以为那是自由。”</p>
<p>"It's poetic justice," Chen Mo turned off the hologram. The room plunged back into darkness. "He made you a prisoner in your own home. Now, we make his prison his grave."</p>
<p>“这是诗意的正义，”陈默关掉全息图。房间重回黑暗。“他曾把你囚禁在自己的家里。现在，我们要把他的监狱变成他的坟墓。”</p>
