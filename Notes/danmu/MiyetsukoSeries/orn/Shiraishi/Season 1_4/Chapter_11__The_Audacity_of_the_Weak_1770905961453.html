<p>Chapter 11: The Audacity of the Weak</p>
<p>第 11 章：弱者的傲慢</p>
<p>Yui’s voice trembled with a mixture of rage and disbelief as she repeated the toxic logic he had used to justify his betrayal.</p>
<p>结衣的声音因愤怒和难以置信而颤抖，她重复着那个男人用来为背叛辩护的有毒逻辑。</p>
<p>"He didn't even bother to hide it this time," she choked out, "He actually argued that every man in Tokyo has been with Mizuki Nemuru, as if it were some mandatory rite of passage."</p>
<p>“他这次甚至都懒得装了，”她哽咽着说，“他居然辩称东京每个男人都搞过美月眠，仿佛那是什么必经的成人礼一样。”</p>
<p>He had the nerve to quote a disgusting street proverb: "Though ten thousand palaces of pleasure might stand, none can compare to one Mizuki Nemuru."</p>
<p>他竟然还有脸引用那句恶心的市井传言：“纵有万座合欢殿，不及一个美月眠。”</p>
<p>"He told me I was being narrow-minded," Yui whispered, her eyes red and raw. "He said, 'Am I even a man if I don't go?' as if his masculinity depended on a woman who doesn't know his name."</p>
<p>“他怪我小心眼，”结衣低声呢喃，双眼通红，“他说‘我不去还是男人吗？’，仿佛他的男子气概全系于一个甚至不知道他名字的女人身上。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko held her sister tighter, a cold disgust settling in her stomach for a man who used "manhood" as a shield for his own lack of self-control.</p>
<p>美悦子将姐姐抱得更紧了，胃里翻涌着一阵冰冷的恶心——为了那个用“男子气概”当作挡箭牌，来掩盖自己毫无自律之心的男人。</p>
<p>She thought of Shiraishi—of the way he looked at her as his equal, his partner in pleasure—and realized that true strength didn't need to be validated by a "Vessel."</p>
<p>她想到了白石——想到他如何将她视为平等的享乐伙伴——她意识到，真正的强大根本不需要通过一个“容器”来证明。</p>
