<p>第二十五章：幽灵的来电</p>
<p>Kurosaki Heavy Industries. President's Office.</p>
<p>黑崎重工。社长办公室。</p>
<p>The atmosphere was suffocating. Kurosaki Soichiro stared at his tablet. His hands, usually steady enough to sign billion-dollar contracts, were trembling slightly.</p>
<p>气氛令人窒息。黑崎宗一郎死死盯着平板电脑。他那双签惯了百亿合同的手，竟然在微微颤抖。</p>
<p>On the screen was a photo.</p>
<p>It was artistic, black and white. A man's hand gripping a woman's waist tightly, leaving deep indentations in the soft flesh. The woman's face was turned away, but the mole on her neck and the diamond ring on her finger were unmistakably his wife's.</p>
<p>And in the corner of the photo, placed deliberately on the bedside table, was a USB drive. A silver USB drive stained with blood.</p>
<p>屏幕上是一张照片。</p>
<p>那是艺术般的黑白照。一只男人的手紧紧抓着女人的腰，在软肉上留下了深深的指印。女人的脸侧过去，但脖子上的那颗痣和手指上的钻戒，无可辩驳地属于他的妻子。</p>
<p>而在照片的角落，特意放在床头柜上的，是一个U盘。一个沾着血的银色U盘。</p>
<p>The message attached was simple:</p>
<p>“The purge failed. The ghost is back. - 1024”</p>
<p>附带的信息很简单：</p>
<p>“清洗失败。幽灵回来了。——1024”</p>
<p>"Impossible..." Kurosaki smashed the tablet on the floor. "The system log confirmed the deletion!"</p>
<p>“不可能……”黑崎把平板电脑砸在地上。“系统日志确认删除了！”</p>
<p>At that moment, the red secure phone on his desk rang. It was Minister Tanaka.</p>
<p>就在这时，桌上的红色保密电话响了。是田中大臣。</p>
<p>Kurosaki picked it up. "Minister, I..."</p>
<p>黑崎接起电话。“大臣，我……”</p>
<p>"Kurosaki! Are you insane?" Tanaka's roar came from the other end. "How dare you send that ledger to my private email? Are you threatening me? If I go down, I'm taking your whole company with me!"</p>
<p>“黑崎！你疯了吗？”田中的咆哮声从对面传来。“你竟敢把那本账簿发到我的私人邮箱？你在威胁我？如果我倒了，我会拉着你的整个公司陪葬！”</p>
<p>Click. The line went dead.</p>
<p>咔哒。 电话挂断。</p>
<p>Kurosaki stood frozen. He realized what had happened. He had been played. The "adultery" was a cover. The "purge" was a theft. And now, his wife was dismantling his empire brick by brick from the shadows.</p>
<p>黑崎僵在原地。他意识到发生了什么。他被耍了。“偷情”是掩护。“清洗”是盗窃。而现在，他的妻子正在阴影里，一块砖一块砖地拆掉他的帝国。</p>
<p>He sat down heavily in his chair, pressing the intercom.</p>
<p>他重重地坐回椅子里，按下对讲机。</p>
<p>"Activate the 'Cleanup Crew'. Level 1 authorization."</p>
<p>“启动‘清道夫’小组。一级授权。”</p>
<p>"Target, sir?"</p>
<p>“目标是谁，先生？”</p>
<p>"My wife. And that man." Kurosaki's voice was devoid of any emotion. "Bring me their heads. And the drive."</p>
<p>“我的妻子。还有那个男人。”黑崎的声音没有任何感情。“把他们的头带回来。还有那个U盘。”</p>
