<p>第二十二章：国王与王后</p>
<p>The misunderstanding was cleared. The atmosphere in the room shifted instantly.</p>
<p>误会解除了。房间里的气氛瞬间变了。</p>
<p>It wasn't hate anymore. It was a collision of two high-IQ predators acknowledging each other's ruthlessness.</p>
<p>不再是仇恨。而是两头高智商的掠食者互相认可了对方的冷酷。</p>
<p>"So," Chen Mo pushed the USB drive forward. "You won the bet. Here is the list."</p>
<p>“所以，”陈默把U盘推了过去。“你赌赢了。这是名单。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko didn't take it. She looked at Chen Mo, her breathing becoming slightly heavier.</p>
<p>美悦子没接。她看着陈默，呼吸稍微变得有些粗重。</p>
<p>"You survived the trap I set. You possess the weapon that can kill a god. You are no longer my pawn, Chen Mo."</p>
<p>“你从我设的陷阱里活下来了。你手里握着能弑神的武器。你不再是我的棋子了，陈默。”</p>
<p>She stood up, untying the belt of her silk robe. The white fabric slid down her shoulders like water, revealing that majestic, flawless body that had haunted Chen Mo's dreams.</p>
<p>她站起身，解开了丝绸睡袍的腰带。白色的布料像水一样顺着肩膀滑落，露出了那具宏伟、无瑕、让陈默魂牵梦绕的身体。</p>
<p>Under the light, her curves were even more exaggerated than in the dark. The fullness of her chest, the softness of her waist, every inch of her flesh was trembling with the excitement of victory and danger.</p>
<p>在灯光下，她的曲线比在黑暗中更加夸张。胸前的饱满，腰肢的柔软，每一寸肉体都在因为胜利和危险的兴奋而颤栗。</p>
<p>"Now, you are my partner. My... accomplice."</p>
<p>“现在，你是我的合伙人。我的……共犯。”</p>
<p>She walked over, straddling Chen Mo's lap again. But this time, it wasn't acting. It was a reward. A reward from the Queen to her bravest knight.</p>
<p>她走过来，再次跨坐在陈默腿上。但这一次，不是演戏。是奖赏。是女王对她最勇敢骑士的奖赏。</p>
<p>"You said on the phone you wanted my 'sincere body'?" She grabbed Chen Mo's hand and placed it on her heart. It was beating fast.</p>
<p>“你在电话里说，你要我‘诚实的身体’？”她抓着陈默的手，按在自己的心口。那里跳得很快。</p>
<p>"Take it. We celebrate tonight. Tomorrow... we declare war on Kurosaki."</p>
<p>“拿去吧。今晚我们庆祝。明天……我们向黑崎宣战。”</p>
<p>Chen Mo looked at her. The anger in his heart vanished, replaced by a conquering desire to completely dominate this dangerous woman.</p>
<p>陈默看着她。心里的怒火消失了，取而代之的是一种想要彻底征服这个危险女人的征服欲。</p>
<p>He grabbed her waist and pulled her down fiercely.</p>
<p>他搂住她的腰，猛地将她拉向自己。</p>
<p>"This time," Chen Mo bit her earlobe, whispering, "I will be on top."</p>
<p>“这一次，”陈默咬着她的耳垂，低声说，“我在上面。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko threw her head back, laughing a broken, enchanting laugh.</p>
<p>美悦子仰起头，发出破碎而迷人的笑声。</p>
<p>"As you wish... my King."</p>
<p>“如你所愿……我的国王。”</p></div>
