<p>容器</p>
<p>Part 1: The Face of a Drowned Goddess</p>
<p>溺水女神的面容</p>
<p>Saori’s beauty was a quiet catastrophe. It wasn't the aggressive glitter of the Lin family; it was the pale, transcendent glow of moonlight on deep water. Her skin possessed a translucent quality that seemed to bruise if a gaze held it too long, and her eyes were always slightly misted, as if she were mourning a world she didn't know how to refuse. She was a masterpiece of biological submission, a woman whose very bone structure seemed designed to yield.</p>
<p>沙织的美丽是一场安静的灾难。那不是林家那种侵略性的闪耀，而是深潭月光般苍白、超脱的光泽。她的肌肤透着一种近乎透明的质感，仿佛目光停留太久都会留下淤青；她的双眼总是带着轻微的迷离，像是正在为一个小她不知该如何拒绝的世界而哀悼。她是生物性顺从的杰作，一个连骨架仿佛都为了妥协而生的女人。</p>
<p>To look at her was to want to possess her, and to ask her for anything was to receive it. Whether it was a billionaire like Kurosaki or the lowliest janitor at the academy, if they lowered their voice or grabbed her wrist, Saori would simply offer a faint, tragic smile and give them whatever they craved. She had no "no" in her vocabulary; she only had "yes" whispered through a haze of soft, compliant heat.</p>
<p>望向她便会生出占有的渴望，而向她索求任何东西都定能得到回应。无论是黑崎那样的亿万富翁，还是学院里最卑微的门房，只要他们压低声音或抓住她的手腕，沙织只会报以一丝淡淡的、悲剧性的微笑，然后交出他们渴望的一切。她的字典里没有“不”，只有在柔软、顺从的燥热中呢喃出的“好”。</p>
<p>Part 2: Under the Console</p>
<p>控制台下</p>
<p>Saori lowered her eyes, her lashes trembling softly. She first pressed the softest part of her lips against it, only lightly touching the very tip of the glans, as if confirming its warmth and pulse. Then she parted her mouth slightly, the tip of her tongue slipping out to tap the urethral opening once, drawing that drop of pre-fluid into her mouth and tasting a faint hint of salt.</p>
<p>纱织垂下眼，睫毛轻颤，先用嘴唇最柔软的部分贴上去，只轻轻碰了碰龟头最前端，像在确认它的温度和跳动。接着她微微张开嘴，舌尖探出来，尖端先是点了一下马眼，把那滴前液卷进嘴里，尝到一点淡淡的咸。</p>
<p>The warmth and moisture of her mouth instantly enveloped the entire glans. Her lips tightened into a snug circle, resting just beneath the coronal ridge, while her tongue immediately went to work—first flattening along the underside of the glans and slowly, firmly scraping upward from the frenulum to the tip, then using the tip of her tongue to flick rapidly from side to side along that most sensitive seam, brushing over it again and again like a tiny soft brush.</p>
<p>温暖湿润的口腔瞬间包裹住整个龟头，她的嘴唇收成一个紧致的圆，卡在冠状沟下面，舌头立刻开始工作——先是平铺在龟头下侧，用舌面缓慢而用力地往上刮，从系带一路舔到马眼，再用舌尖在那条最敏感的缝隙里快速地左右拨弄，像小刷子一样反复刷过。</p>
<p>Part 3: The Pulse of Betrayal</p>
<p>背叛的脉动</p>
<p>As the green line of Miyetsuko’s pulse spiked on the screen above, Saori’s moans became a frantic, rhythmic sobbing. She wasn't crying from pain or joy; she was simply reacting, her body a perfect instrument played by a dozen different masters. In the heat of the friction, the secrets began to leak out of her like sweat.</p>
<p>当上方屏幕里美悦子的脉搏绿线剧烈波动时，沙织的呻吟变成了促迫、富有节奏的啜泣。她并非因痛苦或喜悦而哭，她只是在产生反应，她的身体是一件完美的乐器，曾被一打不同的主人演奏过。在摩擦的燥热中，那些秘密像汗水一样从她身上渗了出来。</p>
<p>"The internal audits... they’re in the black safe," she gasped, her voice breaking as Makoto’s pace became violent. "I... I gave the combination to the auditor yesterday... because he asked so nicely... he promised it wouldn't hurt..."</p>
<p>“内部审计……在那个黑色保险箱里，”她喘息着，随着诚的动作变得狂暴，她的声音也变得破碎。“我……我昨天把密码给审计员了……因为他求我的样子很温柔……他说不会弄痛我的……”</p>
<p>Every man who entered her left a secret behind, and every man who came after took one away. She was the Lin family’s most fatal leak, not because she was evil, but because she was empty. She was a vessel that anyone could pour themselves into, and anyone could drink from.</p>
<p>每一个占有她的男人都会留下一个秘密，而每一个随后的男人又会带走一个。她是林家最致命的泄密口，不是因为她邪恶，而是因为她空虚。她是一个任何人都可以倾注自我，也任何人都可以从中啜饮的容器。</p>
<p>Part 4: The Aftermath of Silk</p>
<p>丝绸的余波</p>
<p>When it was over, Saori slumped against the floor of the van, her white blouse torn, her hair a chaotic halo of ruined elegance. She wiped a smudge of fluid from her chin with a trembling, slender finger. Her eyes were vacant, reflecting the flickering lights of the monitors. She looked at the image of Miyetsuko on the screen—the "無垢 (Muku)" swan—with a look of profound, silent pity.</p>
<p>一切结束后，沙织瘫倒在车厢地板上，白色的衬衫被撕破，头发像一圈混乱的、毁掉的优雅光环。她用颤抖、纤细的手指擦掉下巴上的一抹液体。她的眼神空洞，倒映着监视器闪烁的光。她看着屏幕上美悦子的影像——那只“无垢”的天鹅——眼中流露出深沉而无声的怜悯。</p></div>
