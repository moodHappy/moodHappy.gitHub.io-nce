<p>第三章：雨中的单车</p>
<p>【The Ivory Tower: 99% Pure White】</p>
<p>【象牙塔：99%的纯白】</p>
<p>Part 1: The Broken Carriage</p>
<p>第一部分：破碎的马车</p>
<p>The afternoon sky over St. Cecilia’s turned a heavy, bruised grey. As the final bell rang, a sudden downpour turned the campus into a world of blurred watercolors. Miyetsuko stood at the main gate, waiting for the family sedan.</p>
<p>圣塞西莉亚学院上空的午后，天空变成了沉重的、淤青般的灰色。随着最后一刻铃声响起，一场暴雨将校园变成了模糊的水彩世界。美悦子站在大门处，等待着自家的轿车。</p>
<p>But the black Mercedes didn't move. The driver, an old man who had served the Lins for decades, was looking at the engine with a face full of despair. "I’m so sorry, Miyetsuko-sama. The tires... they’ve been slashed. All four of them."</p>
<p>但那辆黑色奔驰纹丝不动。为林家服务了数十年的老司机正盯着引擎，满脸绝望。“万分抱歉，美悦子大人。轮胎……被割破了。四个全都被割破了。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko looked at the jagged cuts in the rubber. It looked deliberate, like a warning. But she just thought it was a random act of school vandalism. "It's okay, Kobayashi. I’ll call a taxi."</p>
<p>美悦子看着橡胶上参差不齐的切口。这看起来是故意的，像个警告。但她只以为是学校里的某种随机恶作剧。“没关系，小林先生。我打车回去。”</p>
<p>Part 2: Two People, One Umbrella</p>
<p>第二部分：两人，一伞</p>
<p>"A taxi won't get through this traffic for an hour, Princess."</p>
<p>“这种路况，出租车一小时也进不来，公主。”</p>
<p>A splash of water, and Takumi skidded to a halt in front of her on a beat-up mountain bike. He was wearing a transparent rain poncho, looking like a drowned but happy rat.</p>
<p>一阵水花飞溅，拓海骑着一辆破旧的山地车在她面前急刹停住。他穿着一件透明的雨衣，看起来像一只落水却快乐的落汤鸡。</p>
<p>"Hop on. I’ll give you a lift to the station," he grinned, patting the metal rack over the back wheel.</p>
<p>“上来吧。我载你去车站，”他笑着拍了拍后轮上的金属架。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stared at the rack. It was cold, hard, and completely undignified. "On that? I’ve never... I’m wearing a skirt."</p>
<p>美悦子盯着那个支架。它又冷又硬，而且完全有失身份。“坐‘那个’？我从来没……而且我穿着裙子。”</p>
<p>"Then sit sideways and hold onto my waist. Unless you want to wait here until the school floods," Takumi laughed.</p>
<p>“那就侧着坐，搂住我的腰。除非你想在这儿等到学校被淹，”拓海大笑着说。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko hesitated, then closed her eyes and climbed on. As the bike surged forward into the rain, she gasped, her hands instinctively clutching his warm, solid waist. The wind whipped her hair, and the smell of rain mixed with his peppermint scent. For the first time, she wasn't being driven in a soundproof box. She was in the world, feeling every bump in the road, every drop of water. It was terrifying, and it was the most exciting thing she had ever felt.</p>
<p>美悦子迟疑了一下，闭上眼睛爬了上去。随着单车冲进雨幕，她惊呼一声，双手本能地紧紧搂住他温暖而结实的腰。风卷起了她的发丝，雨水的味道与他身上的薄荷香气交织在一起。这是第一次，她没有坐在隔音的盒子里被载着走。她就在世界之中，感受着路面的每一次颠簸，每一滴雨水。这很恐怖，却也是她感受过最令人兴奋的事。</p>
<p>【The Undercurrent: 1% Pitch Black】</p>
<p>【暗流：1%的极黑】</p>
<p>Part 3: The Price of Maintenance</p>
<p>第三部分：维护的代价</p>
<p>Condition Check: Purity 99.8%. Warning: External interference detected.</p>
<p>状态检查：纯净度 99.8%。警告：监测到外部干扰。</p>
<p>While Miyetsuko felt the thrill of the rain, Saori was in the school’s underground parking lot, facing the "vandals."</p>
<p>当美悦子感受着雨中的悸动时，沙织正身处学校的地下停车场，面对着那些“破坏者”。</p>
<p>Three men in tracksuits, the ones who had slashed the tires, were laughing, holding a canister of gasoline. "Just a little reminder for Mr. Lin. If the interest isn't doubled by tonight, the next thing to be slashed won't be rubber."</p>
<p>三个穿着田径服、割破轮胎的男人正笑着，手里提着一罐汽油。“给林先生的一点小提醒。如果今晚利息不翻倍，下次被割开的可就不是橡胶了。”</p>
<p>Saori stepped out from the shadows. She had removed her glasses, and her eyes were cold, reflecting the dim fluorescent lights. "You went too far. She was almost there when you did it."</p>
<p>沙织从阴影中走出来。她摘下了眼镜，双眼冰冷，倒映着昏暗的荧光灯。“你们做得太过分了。你们动手的时候，她差点就在现场。”</p>
<p>"So what, Secretary-san? You going to call the cops?" One man sneered, walking toward her.</p>
<p>“那又怎样，秘书小姐？你要报警吗？”一个男人冷笑着走向她。</p>
<p>Saori didn't call the cops. She reached into her bag and pulled out a heavy, steel baton. In three swift, brutal movements, the man was on the ground, clutching a shattered kneecap. The other two froze.</p>
<p>沙织没有报警。她伸手进包，掏出了一根沉重的钢制甩棍。三次迅速而残暴的动作后，那个男人倒在地上，捂着碎掉的膝盖骨。另外两人愣住了。</p>
<p>"The interest will be paid," Saori whispered, her voice like a razor. She stepped over the groaning man, her high heels clicking on the concrete. "But if you ever bring this filth near her again, I won't just break your legs. I'll make sure you vanish from the system entirely."</p>
<p>“利息会付的，”沙织低声说道，声音如剃刀般锋利。她跨过呻吟的男人，高跟鞋在水泥地上发出清脆的响声。“但如果你们再敢把这些脏事带到她身边，我不止会打断你们的腿。我会确保你们从这个系统里彻底消失。”</p>
<p>She wiped a drop of blood off her blazer, put her glasses back on, and checked her watch. She had ten minutes to get to the station and meet Miyetsuko with a dry towel and a warm smile.</p>
<p>她擦掉西装上的一滴血，重新戴上眼镜，看了看表。她还有十分钟时间赶到车站，带着干毛巾和温暖的微笑去迎接美悦子。</p>
<p>Episode 3 Ending:</p>
<p>Miyetsuko arrives at the station, her hair soaked and her cheeks flushed pink. She says goodbye to Takumi, who gives her a messy high-five before riding off.</p>
<p>美悦子到达车站，头发湿透，脸颊泛着绯红。她向拓海告别，拓海在骑走前给了她一个大大咧咧的高分。</p>
<p>Saori is there, waiting. She wraps a soft pashmina around Miyetsuko’s shoulders. "Oh dear, the car broke down. You must have had a terrible time getting here."</p>
<p>沙织就在那儿等着。她把一条柔软的羊绒披肩裹在美悦子的肩上。“噢天哪，车坏了。您赶过来一定吃了不少苦吧。”</p>
<p>"No," Miyetsuko beams, her eyes glowing with a light Saori has never seen. "It was... the most fun I've ever had, Saori."</p>
<p>“不，”美悦子眉开眼笑，眼中闪烁着沙织从未见过的光芒。“这是……我过得最开心的一天，沙织。”</p>
<p>Saori smiles back, her hand secretly trembling in her pocket from the adrenaline of the fight.</p>
<p>沙织回以微笑，口袋里的手却因为刚才搏斗后的肾上腺素而在微微颤抖。</p></div>
