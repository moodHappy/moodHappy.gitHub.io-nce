<p>第十八章：大理石间的回响</p>
<p>Part 1: The Suffocating Toast</p>
<p>窒息的祝酒</p>
<p>Masato Bai-Feng raised his glass, the red wine looking like a pool of blood in the crystal. He didn't look at Mr. Lin; his eyes were locked onto Miyetsuko’s trembling hands. The air in the private room was thick with the smell of expensive steak and the underlying rot of a transaction.</p>
<p>白凤雅人举起酒杯，晶莹剔透的杯中红酒宛如一滩鲜血。他没有看林先生，目光死死锁住美悦子颤抖的双手。私人包间里的空气凝重，弥漫着昂贵牛排的味道，以及交易背后那种潜伏的腐朽气息。</p>
<p>"To the Last Line of Defense," Masato toasted, his voice a low purr. "May she always remain this pristine."</p>
<p>“为了最后的防线，”雅人举杯祝酒，声音低沉如猫鸣。“愿她永远如此纯洁无暇。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko felt a surge of nausea. The way he said "pristine" made her feel like a piece of fruit being inspected for bruises. She stood up abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. "Excuse me... I need to freshen up."</p>
<p>美悦子感到一阵强烈的恶心。他口中的“纯洁”让她觉得自己像是一颗正被检查是否有淤青的水果。她突然站起身，椅子在地面上发出刺耳的摩擦声。“失礼了……我去补下妆。”</p>
<p>Part 2: The Sterile Silence</p>
<p>无菌的寂静</p>
<p>The hallway to the restrooms was a tunnel of gold leaf and hushed carpet. Inside the ladies' room, the white marble was blindingly bright. Miyetsuko leaned over the sink, splashing cold water on her face. The platinum necklace—Makoto’s gift—felt icy against her skin.</p>
<p>通往洗手间的走廊是一条贴金箔、铺着厚地毯的隧道。女洗手间内，白大理石亮得刺眼。美悦子俯身在水池边，将冷水拍在脸上。颈间的铂金项链——诚送的礼物——贴在皮肤上冰冷刺骨。</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, trying to steady her heart. But as the silence settled, she heard it. A faint, rhythmic thudding against the wall of the far stall. And then, a sound that made her blood freeze.</p>
<p>她深吸一口气，试图稳住心跳。然而，当寂静降临时，她听到了。远处隔间墙壁上传来微弱、富有节奏的撞击声。紧接着，一个让她的血液瞬间凝固的声音传了出来。</p>
<p>Part 3: The Mirror of Degradation</p>
<p>堕落的镜像</p>
<p>It was a moan—low, honeyed, and utterly broken. It was Saori’s voice.</p>
<p>那是吟哦声——低沉、如蜜般酥麻，却又透着彻底的破碎。那是沙织的声音。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stood paralyzed. Through the gap in the marble partitions, the sounds became vivid and raw. There was the wet slap of skin on skin, and the raspy, arrogant breathing of a man who wasn't her father.</p>
<p>美悦子僵在原地。透过大理石隔板的缝隙，那声音变得清晰而原始。那是皮肉撞击的湿润啪嗒声，还有一个男人的粗重、傲慢的喘息声——那人显然不是她的父亲。</p>
<p>"Please... not so hard..." Saori’s voice was a ghost of a whisper, interrupted by a sharp, throat-deep gasp as the man drove into her again. "The Master... he's waiting..."</p>
<p>“求你……轻点……”沙织的声音微弱如幽灵，随着男人再次深入她的体内，那声音断成了一串尖锐、深及喉咙的喘息。“老爷……还在等……”</p>
<p>"Lin is busy drinking his own ruin," the man grunted. It was one of Bai-Feng’s junior partners. "You’re just the appetizer, Saori. Keep that mouth busy."</p>
<p>“林正忙着喝他的破产酒呢，”男人喘着粗气说道。那是白凤基金的一个初级合伙人。“你只是个开胃菜，沙织。嘴巴别停下。”</p>
<p>Part 4: The Sound of the Cage</p>
<p>囚笼之音</p>
<p>Miyetsuko gripped the edge of the marble sink so hard her nails chipped. She heard Saori’s moans intensify—a rhythmic,入骨 (bone-deep) sound of a woman who had long ago traded her dignity for the survival of a falling house. It was a symphony of submission, a wet, frantic record of what "rescue" actually sounded like.</p>
<p>美悦子死死扣住大理石洗手池的边缘，指甲都崩裂了。她听到沙织的呻吟变得更加剧烈——那是一种入骨的、富有节奏的声音，属于一个早已为了豪门的苟延残喘而交易掉尊严的女人。这是一场顺从的交响乐，是所谓“救助”真实面貌的湿冷、疯狂的记录。</p>
<p>Every thud against the wall felt like a hammer blow to Miyetsuko’s world. She realized that while she played her beautiful concertos, Saori was being dismantled piece by piece in the shadows of the Palace Hotel.</p>
<p>每一次撞击墙壁的声音，都像是一记重锤敲在美悦子的世界上。她意识到，当她弹奏着优美的协奏曲时，沙织正是在皇宫酒店的阴影里，被一点一点拆解。</p>
<p>Suddenly, her phone buzzed again in her clutch bag.</p>
<p>突然，她手包里的手机再次震动起来。</p>
<p>The music in the bathroom is quite evocative, isn't it?</p>
<p>洗手间里的音乐相当迷人，不是吗？</p>
<p>Makoto was listening. He was always listening.</p>
<p>诚在听。他一直都在倾听。</p></div>
