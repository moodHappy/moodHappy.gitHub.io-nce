<p>第十三章：初步的救助</p>
<p>Part 1: The New Table</p>
<p>新的谈判桌</p>
<p>The meeting took place in a private club in Ginza, far from the prying eyes of the Kurosaki group. Mr. Lin sat across from two men in charcoal suits—representatives of the Bai-Feng Investment Fund. The air was thick with the scent of expensive cigars and the cold smell of money.</p>
<p>会面在银座的一家私人俱乐部举行，远离黑崎集团的眼线。林先生坐在两个穿着炭灰色西装的男人对面——他们是白凤投资基金的代表。空气中弥漫着昂贵雪茄的味道和金钱那股冷冰冰的气息。</p>
<p>Saori stood behind Mr. Lin, her hands folded neatly in front of her. She was a silent ghost, her high collar once again shielding the marks on her skin. The investors didn't look at the financial reports for long; they spent more time looking at the woman standing in the shadows.</p>
<p>沙织站在林先生身后，双手整齐地交叠在身前。她像个沉默的幽灵，高领再次遮住了皮肤上的痕迹。投资者们并没有在财务报告上停留太久，他们花更多的时间盯着站在阴影里的那个女人。</p>
<p>Part 2: The Terms of Salvation</p>
<p>救赎的条款</p>
<p>"The Lin group still has value," the lead investor said, tapping a gold pen against the table. "But the risk is high. Kurosaki is a dangerous enemy to have. If we step in, we want absolute control over your shipping routes."</p>
<p>“林氏集团仍有价值，”领头的投资者说道，用金笔敲打着桌面。“但风险很高。黑崎是个危险的敌人。如果我们介入，我们要对你们的航运线路拥有绝对控制权。”</p>
<p>Mr. Lin nodded eagerly. He was willing to give up anything to keep his title and his mansion. "Of course. Whatever you need. We just need the liquidity by Monday to stop the foreclosure."</p>
<p>林先生迫不及待地连连点头。为了保住他的头衔和大宅，他愿意放弃任何东西。“当然。只要你们需要。我们只需要在周一前拿到流动资金，好阻止止赎。”</p>
<p>Part 3: The Preliminary Handshake</p>
<p>初步的握手</p>
<p>The lead investor smiled, a thin, predatory expression. He stood up and offered his hand. "We have a preliminary agreement. We will inject the first round of capital. But, as a gesture of goodwill, we would like Miss Mikage to spend the weekend at our retreat to... facilitate the paperwork."</p>
<p>领头的投资者笑了笑，露出一个浅薄且掠食性的表情。他站起身，伸出了手。“我们达成了初步协议。我们会注入第一轮资金。但是，作为诚意的表示，我们希望御影小姐能到我们的度假村度过周末，以便……协助处理文书工作。”</p>
<p>Mr. Lin didn't hesitate for a second. He didn't even look back at Saori. "Saori is a professional. She will be happy to assist you in any way possible."</p>
<p>林先生一秒钟都没有犹豫。他甚至没有回头看沙织一眼。“沙织很专业。她会很乐意以任何可能的方式协助你们。”</p>
<p>Part 4: The Triumph of the Blind</p>
<p>盲目的凯旋</p>
<p>As they walked out of the club, Mr. Lin was beaming. He felt like he had cheated death. He turned to Saori as they waited for the car. "You see, Saori? I told you. The Lin family always finds a way. Go home and pack. Don't disappoint the Bai-Feng people."</p>
<p>走出俱乐部时，林先生满面春风。他觉得自己骗过了死神。等车时，他转向沙织：“看到了吗，沙织？我告诉过你，林家总能找到出路。回家收拾东西吧。别让白凤的人失望。”</p>
<p>Saori bowed, her face reflecting nothing. "Yes, Master."</p>
<p>沙织鞠了一躬，脸上看不出任何情绪。“是的，老爷。”</p>
<p>She knew that the "rescue" was just a change of masters. One predator had stepped back, and another had moved in. And the currency of the deal remained the same: her body and Miyetsuko’s future.</p>
<p>她知道，所谓的“救助”不过是换了个主子。一个掠食者退后了，另一个则步步逼近。而交易的货币从未改变：她的身体，以及美悦子的未来。</p></div>
