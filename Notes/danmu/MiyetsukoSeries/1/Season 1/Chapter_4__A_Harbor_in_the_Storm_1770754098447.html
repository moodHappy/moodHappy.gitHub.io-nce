<p>第四章：风暴中的港湾</p>
<p>Part 1: The Escape</p>
<p>逃离</p>
<p>Miyetsuko didn't wait for her father's next words. She grabbed a thin coat and ran out of the study. The front door was heavy, but she pushed it open and stepped into the rain.</p>
<p>美悦子没等父亲再说下一句话。她抓起一件薄外套，冲出了书房。大门很重，但她推开了它，走进了雨中。</p>
<p>She didn't call for a driver. She walked to the main road and hailed a taxi. The driver looked at her wet dress in the rearview mirror but said nothing. She gave him the address of a small apartment building in Minato.</p>
<p>她没有叫司机，而是走到大路上拦了一辆出租车。司机从后视镜看着她湿透的礼服，什么也没说。她给了他一个位于港区的公寓地址。</p>
<p>She reached into her pocket and realized she only had a few bills. It was enough for the fare, but barely.</p>
<p>她摸了摸口袋，发现只有几张钞票。够付车费，但也仅此而已。</p>
<p>Part 2: The Door to Ayaka</p>
<p>向绫香求助</p>
<p>Sato Ayaka opened the door on the third ring. She was wearing a simple tracksuit, her hair tied in a messy bun. She stared at Miyetsuko, who was shivering and pale.</p>
<p>佐藤绫香在门铃响第三声时开了门。她穿着一件简单的运动服，头发扎成凌乱的发髻。她盯着浑身发抖、脸色苍白的美悦子，愣住了。</p>
<p>"Miyetsuko? What happened to you? The party isn't over yet, is it?" Ayaka asked, pulling her inside.</p>
<p>“美悦子？你怎么了？宴会还没结束吧？”绫香问道，把她拉进屋里。</p>
<p>The apartment was small and smelled of instant ramen. It was a world away from the Lin estate. Miyetsuko sat on the edge of a cheap fabric sofa, her wet dress dripping onto the floor.</p>
<p>公寓很小，弥漫着方便面的味道。这和林家大宅简直是两个世界。美悦子坐在廉价布艺沙发的边缘，湿透的礼服在地板上滴着水。</p>
<p>Part 3: The Confession</p>
<p>倾诉</p>
<p>"My father is going to sell me," Miyetsuko said. Her voice was flat, devoid of its usual high-class melody. "The company is failing. He signed a deal with the Kurosaki family."</p>
<p>“我父亲要把我卖了，”美悦子说道。她的声音很平，失去了往日那种高贵感。“公司要垮了。他和黑崎家签了协议。”</p>
<p>Ayaka handed her a warm towel. She sat cross-legged on the floor in front of her. "The Kurosakis? But they’re vultures. Everyone knows that. Can't your father find someone else?"</p>
<p>绫香递给她一条热毛巾，在美悦子面前的地板上盘腿坐下。“黑崎家？可他们是秃鹫啊，大家都知道。你父亲不能找别人吗？”</p>
<p>"There is no one else," Miyetsuko whispered. She clutched the towel tightly. "He said I’m the last thing he has left to trade. I felt like a piece of furniture being appraised."</p>
<p>“没有别人了，”美悦子低声说。她紧紧攥着毛巾。“他说我是他最后剩下的筹码。我觉得自己就像一件正在被估价的家具。”</p>
<p>Part 4: The Invisible Chain</p>
<p>无形的锁链</p>
<p>Ayaka reached out and touched the platinum necklace around Miyetsuko’s neck. The diamond caught the dim light of the apartment.</p>
<p>绫香伸手碰了碰美悦子颈间的铂金项链。钻石折射着公寓里昏暗的光。</p>
<p>"This is beautiful," Ayaka said, trying to lighten the mood. "Did he give this to you? Maybe he’s trying to make it up to you."</p>
<p>“这真漂亮，”绫香试图缓和气氛，“是他给你的吗？也许他是想补偿你。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko touched the cold metal. She didn't tell Ayaka that it was a gift from Hasegawa Makoto, the man with the predatory eyes. She didn't know that every word she said was being recorded and sent to a black van three blocks away.</p>
<p>美悦子摸了摸冰冷的金属。她没告诉绫香这是长谷川诚送的礼物——那个眼神像掠食者一样的男人。她不知道，她说的每一个字正被记录下来，传送到三个街区外的一辆黑色厢式车里。</p>
<p>"I can't go back, Ayaka. I don't want to be a trophy," she said.</p>
<p>“我回不去了，绫香。我不想当个奖杯，”她说。</p>
<p>Ayaka looked at her friend with pity. She lived in a world of budgets and part-time jobs. She didn't understand the weight of a falling empire. "You can stay here tonight. But tomorrow... what will you do tomorrow?"</p>
<p>绫香怜悯地看着她的朋友。她生活在预算和兼职的世界里，无法理解一个帝国崩塌的重量。“你今晚可以住这儿。但明天……明天你打算怎么办？”</p></div>
