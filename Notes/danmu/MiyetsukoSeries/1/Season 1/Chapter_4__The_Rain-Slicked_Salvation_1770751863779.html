<p>第四章：雨中的救赎</p>
<p>Part 1: The Shattered Glass</p>
<p>碎裂的玻璃</p>
<p>The double doors of the Lin estate burst open, and Miyetsuko stepped into the deluge. The night air was a physical blow, a wall of cold water that instantly began to melt the starch of her white gala dress. She didn't look back at the "fortress" that had just become her auction house.</p>
<p>林家大门砰然撞开，美悦子冲进了暴雨之中。夜晚的空气如同一记重击，冰冷的水墙瞬间开始融化她白色盛装礼服上的浆气。她没有回头看那座刚刚变成她拍卖场的“堡垒”。</p>
<p>Her breath came in ragged, burning gasps. The pavement was slick, a mirror of dark oil and city lights. She ran until her lungs felt like they were filled with broken glass, her expensive silk heels clattering against the indifferent stone.</p>
<p>她的呼吸变得凌乱且灼热。柏油路面湿滑如镜，倒映着黑色油脂与城市灯光。她不停地跑，直到肺部感觉像是填满了碎玻璃，昂贵的丝绸高跟鞋在冷漠的石板路上发出凌乱的脆响。</p>
<p>The "Last Line of Defense" was sprinting toward a void. She had no destination, only a desperate need to outrun the sound of her father’s voice selling her soul.</p>
<p>“最后的防线”正奔向虚无。她没有目的地，只有一种绝望的渴望：逃离父亲出卖她灵魂的那个声音。</p>
<p>Part 2: The Black Umbrella</p>
<p>黑色的伞</p>
<p>A pair of headlights cut through the gloom, blinding her. Miyetsuko stumbled, her foot catching on a jagged edge of the curb. She waited for the impact of the wet asphalt, but it never came.</p>
<p>一对大灯刺破了阴霾，晃得她睁不开眼。美悦子踉跄了一下，脚尖绊在了路边石的锯齿状边缘上。她等待着撞向湿冷沥青路面的冲击，但那一刻并未到来。</p>
<p>Instead, a hand caught her upper arm—firm, steady, and terrifyingly calm. A black umbrella blossomed over her head like a dark flower, shielding her from the vertical assault of the storm.</p>
<p>相反，一只手抓住了她的上臂——有力、平稳，且冷静得令人恐惧。一把黑伞在她头顶如暗之花般绽开，为她挡住了暴雨的垂直侵袭。</p>
<p>"It’s a long way to nowhere, Miyetsuko-sama," a voice murmured.</p>
<p>“美悦子大人，通往‘无处’的路可是很长的，”一个声音低声呢喃。</p>
<p>She looked up, rain dripping from her eyelashes like tears she refused to shed. Hasegawa Makoto stood there, his face half-hidden in the shadows of the silk canopy. He looked like an apparition conjured from the very darkness she was trying to flee.</p>
<p>她抬起头，雨水从睫毛上滴落，像她拒绝流出的泪。长谷川诚站在那里，脸庞半掩在丝绒伞盖的阴影中。他看起来像是一个从她正试图逃离的黑暗中幻化出来的幽灵。</p>
<p>Part 3: The Scent of the Weaver</p>
<p>织网者的气息</p>
<p>He didn't wait for her permission. He stripped off his heavy wool overcoat and draped it over her trembling shoulders. The fabric was warm, smelling of expensive tobacco and a faint, lingering musk that her innocent mind couldn't identify—the ghost of Saori’s skin.</p>
<p>他没有征求她的许可，直接脱下厚重的羊毛大衣，披在她颤抖的肩膀上。大衣是暖的，带着昂贵烟草的味道，还有一种淡淡的、挥之不去的麝香气息，她天真的头脑无法辨识那是什么——那是沙织皮肤留下的余温。</p>
<p>"How... how did you find me?" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the roar of the rain.</p>
<p>“你……你怎么找到我的？”她低声问道，声音在暴雨的轰鸣中微弱得几乎听不见。</p>
<p>"I told you," Makoto said, his thumb brushing a stray, wet lock of hair from her forehead. His touch was electric, a predatory tenderness. "I'm listening to your heart. It’s beating very loudly right now. It sounds like a bird hitting the bars of its cage."</p>
<p>“我告诉过你，”诚说道，拇指掠过她额前一缕湿乱的发丝。他的触碰带着电流，那是一种掠食者般的温柔。“我在倾听你的心声。它现在跳得很响，听起来像一只正在撞击笼栏的鸟。”</p>
<p>He leaned closer, his eyes reflecting the cold, digital precision she had seen in the van, though she didn't know it yet. "The Kurosaki betrothal is a death sentence, Miyetsuko. But I can offer you a different kind of cage. One where you can at least keep your piano."</p>
<p>他凑得更近，眼中闪烁着她在车厢内（尽管她还不知道）见过的那种冷酷的数字精度。“黑崎家的婚约是死刑，美悦子。但我可以为你提供另一种笼子。至少在那儿，你能留住你的钢琴。”</p>
<p>Part 4: The Surrender in the Dark</p>
<p>黑暗中的投降</p>
<p>Miyetsuko looked at the black Mercedes idling at the curb, its exhaust curling like a dragon’s breath in the cold air. She looked at the man who seemed to know her secrets before she even spoke them.</p>
<p>美悦子看着停在路边的黑色奔驰，排气管排出的废气在冷空气中像龙息一样盘旋。她看着这个似乎在她开口之前就已知晓她所有秘密的男人。</p>
<p>She was a girl raised on fairy tales and tactical marriages, but nothing had prepared her for a savior who smelled like a predator. She took a step toward the car, the platinum leash around her neck—his gift—pulsing with a hidden, green light in the shadows.</p>
<p>她是一个在童话和策略婚姻中长大的女孩，但没有任何事能让她准备好面对一个带着掠食者气息的救星。她朝车子迈出了一步，颈间那条铂金枷锁——他的礼物——在阴影中闪烁着隐秘的绿光。</p>
<p>"Take me away," she whispered, grabbing the lapel of his coat as if it were a lifeline. "Just... take me away."</p>
<p>“带我走，”她抓着他大衣的翻领，仿佛那是最后一根救命稻草，低声呢喃道。“只要……带我走就好。”</p>
<p>Makoto smiled, a small, triumphant curve that didn't reach his eyes. He opened the door for her, ushering the swan into the velvet darkness of his world.</p>
<p>诚笑了，那是抹并没到达眼底的、小小的胜利弧度。他为她打开车门，引导这只天鹅步入他世界那丝绒般的黑暗之中。</p></div>
