<p>第十二章：重归宁静的午餐</p>
<p>Part 1: The Message</p>
<p>传递的消息</p>
<p>Saori stood in the dining room as the morning sun hit the crystal chandelier. Her face was a perfect, blank mask. She had scrubbed the scent of the gateman and the auditor from her skin, but her muscles ached with every movement.</p>
<p>当晨光照在水晶吊灯上时，沙织站在餐厅里。她的脸是一副完美的、空白的面具。她已经洗净了皮肤上属于门房和审计员的气味，但每一次移动都牵扯着肌肉的酸痛。</p>
<p>"Kurosaki-san has agreed to a pause," she said to Mr. Lin. "He is in mourning. Out of respect for his son, he will not press the debt until the funeral period is over."</p>
<p>“黑崎先生已经同意暂停行动，”她对林先生说道。“他正处于哀悼期。出于对儿子的尊重，在丧期结束前他不会催债。”</p>
<p>Mr. Lin let out a loud, hysterical laugh. he slammed his hand onto the table, rattling the silverware. "I knew it! The gods are on my side. We have time now, Saori. Time to find a new buyer."</p>
<p>林先生发出一声响亮而歇斯底里的笑声。他重重地拍在桌子上，震得餐具叮当作响。“我就知道！连上天都在帮我。我们现在有时间了，沙织。有时间去找新的买家了。”</p>
<p>Part 2: The Celebration</p>
<p>庆祝</p>
<p>He ordered the chef to prepare a full lunch. He wanted the house to feel like a fortress again. Miyetsuko was summoned from her room, forced to sit at the long table in her silk afternoon dress.</p>
<p>他命令厨师准备一顿丰盛的午餐。他想要这房子重新像一座堡垒。美悦子被从房间传唤下来，穿着丝绸午后礼服坐在长桌旁。</p>
<p>The table was filled with delicacies—truffles, wagyu, and vintage wine. It was a feast paid for with borrowed time and broken promises. To anyone looking in, the Lin family was as powerful as ever.</p>
<p>桌上摆满了山珍海味——松露、和牛和陈年佳酿。这是一场用借来的时间和破碎的承诺换来的盛宴。对任何旁观者而言，林家依然如往常般强大。</p>
<p>"Eat, Miyetsuko," her father urged, his eyes bright with a manic energy. "The danger has passed. We are safe."</p>
<p>“吃吧，美悦子，”父亲催促道，双眼闪烁着狂热的兴奋。“危险已经过去了。我们安全了。”</p>
<p>Part 3: The Flaw</p>
<p>破绽</p>
<p>Miyetsuko picked at her food, her eyes drifting to Saori, who was standing by the sideboard. The secretary was pouring wine with a hand that didn't shake, but her movements were slightly stiff.</p>
<p>美悦子拨弄着食物，目光飘向站在餐柜旁的沙织。秘书倒酒的手没有颤抖，但她的动作显得有些僵硬。</p>
<p>When Saori leaned forward to refill a glass, her high collar shifted for a fraction of a second. Miyetsuko saw it—a dark, angry red mark on the side of her neck. It wasn't a lover's kiss; it was a bruise shaped like a thumb.</p>
<p>当沙织倾身倒酒时，她的高领移动了不到一秒。美悦子看到了——那是她脖子侧面一道暗红、狰狞的红痕。那不是情人的吻痕，而是一道拇指形状的淤青。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko also noticed how Saori shifted her weight carefully, as if walking was an effort. A cold shiver ran down the girl's spine. She looked at her father’s laughing face and then back at the "perfect" secretary. She began to realize that the "peace" they were enjoying had a very specific, physical cost.</p>
<p>美悦子还注意到沙织正小心翼翼地移动重心，仿佛行走是一件苦差事。一股冷颤顺着女孩的脊梁滑下。她看着父亲大笑的脸，又看向那位“完美”的秘书。她开始意识到，他们正在享受的“和平”有着非常具体的、生理上的代价。</p>
<p>Part 4: The Invisible Guest</p>
<p>隐形的宾客</p>
<p>Three blocks away, the audio feed in the black van was crystal clear. Makoto listened to the clinking of silver and the false joy in Mr. Lin's voice. He had the camera zoomed in on Miyetsuko’s face, capturing the exact moment she noticed Saori’s bruise.</p>
<p>三个街区外，黑色厢式车内的音频信号异常清晰。诚倾听着银器的碰撞声和林先生声音里虚假的喜悦。他将镜头推近美悦子的脸，捕捉到了她注意到沙织淤青的那一瞬间。</p>
<p>He leaned into his microphone, his voice a low, private whisper that only the recording would hear. "Look closely, little swan. That is the ink your father uses to sign his extensions."</p>
<p>他凑近麦克风，声音低沉、私密，只有录音设备能听到。“仔细看吧，小天鹅。那就是你父亲用来签署延期协议的墨水。”</p>
<p>He watched as Miyetsuko put down her fork, her appetite gone. The trap wasn't gone; it had just become quiet. And a quiet trap was much more effective.</p>
<p>他看着美悦子放下叉子，胃口全无。陷阱并未消失，只是变安静了。而一个安静的陷阱往往更加致命。</p></div>
