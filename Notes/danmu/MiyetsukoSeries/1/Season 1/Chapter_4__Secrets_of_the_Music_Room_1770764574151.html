<p>第四章：琴房的秘密</p>
<p>【The Ivory Tower: 99.7% Pure White】</p>
<p>【象牙塔：99.7%的纯白】</p>
<p>Part 1: Breaking the Classics</p>
<p>第一部分：打破古典</p>
<p>The music room after hours was Miyetsuko’s personal cathedral. The sun was setting, casting long, amber shadows across the rows of grand pianos. She was playing a technical Etude, her movements precise, cold, and repetitive.</p>
<p>放学后的琴房是美悦子的个人大教堂。夕阳西下，在成排的三角钢琴上投下长长的琥珀色阴影。她正在弹奏一支练习曲，动作精准、冰冷且机械。</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>咔哒。</p>
<p>The back door creaked open. Miyetsuko didn't stop, but her brow furrowed. " Kobayashi-san? I told you I’d call when I’m finished."</p>
<p>后门发出吱呀声。美悦子没有停下，但眉头微蹙。“小林先生？我说过弹完会叫你的。”</p>
<p>"It’s not the driver, Princess. Just the delivery guy."</p>
<p>“不是司机，公主。只是个送货的。”</p>
<p>Takumi leaned against the doorframe, a carton of strawberry milk in his hand. He walked over and sat on the edge of the stage, his sneakers looking scandalous against the polished wood. "You know, you play like you’re afraid of making a mistake. It’s like watching a robot."</p>
<p>拓海靠在门框上，手里拿着一盒草莓牛奶。他走过去坐在舞台边缘，运动鞋在擦亮的木地板衬托下显得有些落拓不羁。“你知道吗，你弹琴的样子就像害怕犯错一样。简直像在看机器人。”</p>
<p>Part 2: The Four-Handed Rebellion</p>
<p>第二部分：四手联弹的叛逆</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stopped, her hands hovering over the keys. "Music is about perfection, Takumi. Especially at my level."</p>
<p>美悦子停了下来，双手悬在琴键上方。“音乐追求的是完美，拓海。尤其是在我这个水平。”</p>
<p>"Music is about how you feel," Takumi retorted. He slid onto the piano bench beside her, forcing her to move over. He placed a finger on a high C and tapped out a simple, bouncy rhythm. "Ever heard this? It’s from that anime opening everyone’s humming."</p>
<p>“音乐追求的是‘感觉’，”拓海反驳道。他挪到她身边的琴凳上，挤得她不得不往旁边挪。他把一个手指放在高音C上，敲出一个简单、轻快的节奏。“听过这个吗？就是大家都在哼的那部动漫的主题曲。”</p>
<p>"I don't watch... anime," Miyetsuko whispered, but her fingers instinctively found the harmony.</p>
<p>“我不看……动漫，”美悦子轻声说，但她的手指却本能地找到了和弦。</p>
<p>"Try it. Follow me."</p>
<p>“试试看。跟着我。”</p>
<p>For the next thirty minutes, the music room didn't echo with Chopin or Bach. It echoed with a messy, joyful, and completely unpolished pop melody. Miyetsuko laughed—a real, breathless sound—as Takumi hit a wrong note and made a goofy face. For the first time, the piano wasn't a chore; it was a toy.</p>
<p>在接下来的三十分钟里，琴房里回荡的不再是肖邦或巴赫。那是一段凌乱、快乐且完全未经雕琢的流行旋律。当拓海弹错一个音并做起怪脸时，美悦子笑了——那是真切、透不过气来的笑声。第一次，钢琴不再是课业，而是一个玩具。</p>
<p>【The Undercurrent: 0.3% Pitch Black】</p>
<p>【暗流：0.3%的极黑】</p>
<p>Part 3: The Invitation to the Deep</p>
<p>第三部分：深渊的邀约</p>
<p>System Notification: Purity remains stable at 99.7%. Stress levels of Guardian "Saori" rising.</p>
<p>系统提示：纯净度稳定在 99.7%。守护者“沙织”压力值上升。</p>
<p>Saori sat in her small office at the academy, her hand hovering over a thick, cream-colored envelope. It wasn't a school document. It was embossed with the silver crest of the Kurosaki Family.</p>
<p>沙织坐在学院的小办公室里，手悬在一个厚厚的米色信封上方。那不是学校文件，上面印着黑崎家族的银色家徽。</p>
<p>"The Chairman was impressed by your... efficient handling of the tire-slashers," a voice said from the shadows. A man in a grey suit stood by the window. "He appreciates talent. He wants to discuss a 'permanent solution' for the Lin debt."</p>
<p>“董事长对你……利落处理割轮胎那伙人的方式印象深刻，”一个声音从阴影中传来。一名穿灰色西装的男人站在窗边。“他欣赏有才华的人。他想聊聊关于林家债务的‘永久解决方案’。”</p>
<p>Saori opened the envelope. Inside was an invitation to a private banquet at the Kurosaki estate. It wasn't a request; it was an order.</p>
<p>沙织打开信封。里面是一张去黑崎大宅参加私人晚宴的请柬。这不是请求，而是命令。</p>
<p>"And Miyetsuko?" Saori asked, her voice cold.</p>
<p>“那美悦子呢？”沙织冷冷地问。</p>
<p>"The Chairman is a man of his word. As long as the interest is managed, the girl stays in her ivory tower," the man replied. "But the price for a 'permanent solution' is high, Saori. You know what he likes."</p>
<p>“董事长是个守信用的人。只要利息能解决，那女孩就能留在她的象牙塔里，”男人回答道，“但‘永久解决方案’的代价很高，沙织。你知道他的喜好。”</p>
<p>Saori looked at the invitation, then at the CCTV monitor on her desk, which showed Miyetsuko and Takumi laughing in the music room. She slowly closed the envelope.</p>
<p>沙织看着请柬，又看了看桌上的监控显示器，屏幕上美悦子和拓海正在琴房里大笑。她缓缓合上了信封。</p>
<p>"I'll be there," she whispered. "Tell him I’ll be there."</p>
<p>“我会去的，”她低声呢喃，“告诉他，我会准时赴约。”</p>
<p>Episode 4 Ending:</p>
<p>Miyetsuko walks out of the music room, her heart feeling lighter than air. She sees Saori waiting in the hallway, looking elegant and composed as always.</p>
<p>美悦子走出琴房，心情轻盈得像要飞起来。她看到沙织在走廊等候，一如既往地优雅、沉着。</p>
<p>"You seem very happy, Miyetsuko-sama," Saori says, her hand trembling slightly as she hides the Kurosaki invitation behind her back.</p>
<p>“您看起来很开心，美悦子大人，”沙织说着，悄悄将黑崎家的请柬藏在身后，手在微微颤抖。</p>
<p>"I am, Saori. I think I finally understand what music is for," Miyetsuko beams.</p>
<p>“我很开心，沙织。我想我终于明白音乐是用来做什么的了，”美悦子笑得灿烂。</p>
<p>Saori smiles, a tragic, beautiful curve of her lips. "I'm glad. Stay that way. Forever."</p>
<p>沙织笑了，唇角的弧度悲伤而优美。“那就好。请一直这样保持下去。永远。”</p></div>
