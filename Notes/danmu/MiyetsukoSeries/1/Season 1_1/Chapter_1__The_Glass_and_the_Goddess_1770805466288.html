<p>第一章：玻璃与女神</p>
<p>【The Ivory Tower: 99.8% Pure White】</p>
<p>【象牙塔：99.8%的纯白】</p>
<p>Part 1: The Morning of the Swan</p>
<p>第一部分：天鹅之晨</p>
<p>The morning sun filtered through the high, arched windows of the music hall at St. Cecilia’s Academy, casting a golden glow on the ivory keys. Miyetsuko Lin sat at the piano, her fingers dancing across a Chopin Nocturne with effortless grace. To everyone who watched her, she was a masterpiece protected by a thick wall of crystal—the perfect, untainted "Glass Swan."</p>
<p>清晨的阳光透过圣塞西莉亚学院音乐厅高大的拱窗，在象牙色的琴键上投下一抹金色的光辉。林美悦子坐在钢琴前，手指带着轻盈而优雅的力量跳动在肖邦的夜曲中。在所有注视她的人眼中，她是一件受厚重水晶墙保护的杰作——那只完美、未受玷污的“玻璃天鹅”。</p>
<p>"Miyetsuko-sama, your tea is ready," a voice whispered from the shadows of the stage.</p>
<p>“美悦子大人，茶准备好了，”一个声音在舞台的阴影中低声响起。</p>
<p>Mizuki Nemuri stood there, holding a porcelain cup with trembling, delicate hands. She was the Lin family’s head secretary, a woman of such ethereal, fragile beauty that she was often called a "Drowned Goddess." Her eyes were always misted, reflecting a soul that had forgotten how to say the word "no." She wasn't guarding Miyetsuko; she was simply existing in her orbit, a silent witness to a purity she could never regain.</p>
<p>美月眠站在那里，用颤抖而纤细的手端着一个瓷杯。她是林家的首席秘书，一个拥有空灵、易碎之美的女人，常被称作“溺水女神”。她的双眼总是带着迷离的雾气，映照出一个早已忘记如何说“不”字的灵魂。她并非在守护美悦子，而仅仅是存在于她的轨道上，作为那份她永远无法重获的纯洁的沉默见证者。</p>
<p>"Thank you, Nemuri-san," Miyetsuko said, her smile as bright as the morning light. She lived in a world where the only problems were minor scales and difficult chords.</p>
<p>“谢谢你，眠姐姐，”美悦子说道，她的笑容像晨光一样灿烂。她生活在一个唯一的问题只是小调音阶和艰涩和弦的世界里。</p>
<p>Part 2: The Peppermint Breeze</p>
<p>第二部分：薄荷味的和风</p>
<p>Suddenly, the rhythmic thud of a basketball echoed from the courtyard outside. Miyetsuko looked toward the window and saw Takumi Rikuno jogging past. He stopped and caught the ball, his white shirt sleeves rolled up to reveal sun-tanned arms. He smelled of peppermint laundry detergent and the raw energy of youth.</p>
<p>突然，庭院外传来了篮球律动的砰砰声。美悦子望向窗外，看到陆野拓海正跑过去。他停下脚步接住球，卷起的白衬衫袖口露出了晒黑的手臂。他身上带着薄荷味洗衣液的气息和原始的青春活力。</p>
<p>"Hey, Piano Girl! You’re still at it?" Takumi shouted, flashing a grin that made Miyetsuko’s heart flutter. To her, he was the "Breaker," the only person who treated her like a human being instead of an expensive asset.</p>
<p>“嘿，钢琴女孩！你还在练啊？”拓海大声喊道，露出的灿烂笑容让美悦子的心跳漏了一拍。对他而言，他是“破窗者”，是唯一一个把她当成“人”而不是昂贵资产来看待的人。</p>
<p>【The Undercurrent: 0.2% Pitch Black】</p>
<p>【暗流：0.2%的极黑】</p>
<p>[SYSTEM CHECK]: Miyetsuko Purity: 99.8%. Container Status: Full Access / Mizuki Nemuri.</p>
<p>【系统检测】：美悦子纯度：99.8%。容器状态：完全开放 / 美月眠。</p>
<p>While the swan played her melody, the Goddess was being emptied in the darkness behind the gym.</p>
<p>当天鹅奏响她的旋律时，女神正被清空在体育馆后方的黑暗里。</p>
<p>A collector for the Kurosaki Group—a man with heavy breath and the smell of stale tobacco—had Mizuki Nemuri pinned against a stack of gym mats. There was no struggle. There was no resistance. Mizuki offered her usual faint, tragic smile as she surrendered to his demands. She was a "Container," a physiological void that accepted every invasion without question.</p>
<p>黑崎集团的一个收账员——一个呼吸沉重、满身陈腐烟草味的男人——将美月眠按在一堆体操垫上。没有挣扎，没有反抗。美月眠在屈从于他的索求时，露出了她那贯常的、淡淡的、悲剧性的微笑。她是一个“容器”，一个毫无疑问地接受每一次入侵的生理性虚无。</p>
<p>The man tore at her silk blouse, exposing her heavy, milk-white breasts. They were full and soft, the nipples already hardening in the damp air as he squeezed them with brutal, grimy fingers. Mizuki let out a soft, compliant moan, her back arching to meet his touch.</p>
<p>男人撕扯着她的丝绸衬衫，露出了她那沉甸甸、奶白色的双乳。它们丰满而柔软，当他用粗暴、肮脏的手指揉搓时，乳尖在潮湿的空气中已经挺立。美月眠发出了一声轻柔、顺从的呻吟，背部弓起以迎合他的触碰。</p>
<p>He unzipped his trousers and forced her down. Mizuki sank to her knees on the cold concrete, her eyes vacant and misted with heat. She took him into her mouth, her tongue working with mechanical, wet perfection to satisfy his urgency. Every time he thrust violently into her throat, she simply opened wider, accepting the filth as if it were her only purpose.</p>
<p>他拉开裤链，强行将她按了下去。美月眠跪在冰冷的水泥地上，双眼空洞，满溢着燥热的雾气。她将他含入口中，舌头带着机械般的、湿润的完美在工作，以满足他的急切。每当他暴虐地刺入她的喉咙，她只是张得更开，接受着那些污秽，仿佛那是她唯一的使命。</p>
<p>"Where is the secondary ledger?" the man gasped, his hand tangling in her hair as he used her body.</p>
<p>“次级账本在哪？”男人喘息着，在使用她的身体时，手插进她的发间。</p>
<p>Mizuki gasped between the rhythmic thrusts, her voice a melodic sigh of betrayal. "In the hidden safe... behind the portrait... in the study..."</p>
<p>美月眠在富有节奏的冲撞间喘息着，声音是带着旋律的、背叛的叹息。“在隐藏保险箱里……在画像后面……在书房里……”</p>
<p>She was an open vessel. In the heat of her absolute submission, the secrets of the Lin family leaked out of her like sweat. Every invasive touch drew more lifeblood from the empire, while Miyetsuko remained safe in her ivory tower, unaware of the rot beneath her feet.</p>
<p>她是一个敞开的器皿。在她绝对顺从的燥热中，林家的机密像汗水一样从她身上渗出。每一次侵入性的触碰都从帝国中榨取了更多的命脉，而美悦子仍安稳地留在她的象牙塔里，对脚下的腐烂一无所知。</p>
<p>Episode Ending:</p>
<p>Miyetsuko finishes her piece and looks out at the sun. She feels happy. Below, Mizuki Nemuri emerges from the shadows, smoothing her skirt, her skin smelling of a stranger’s sweat and the salt of her own submission.</p>
<p>美悦子弹完了她的曲子，望向阳光。她感到幸福。楼下，美月眠从阴影中走出来，抚平裙子，皮肤上散发着陌生男人的汗水味和她自身顺从的咸腥。</p></div>
