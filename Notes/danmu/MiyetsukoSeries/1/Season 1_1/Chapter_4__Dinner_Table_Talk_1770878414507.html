<p>Chapter 4: Dinner Table Talk</p>
<p>第 4 章：餐桌上的闲聊</p>
<p>The dining table was filled with the steam of freshly cooked rice and the savory aroma of braised pork. Miyetsuko sat across from her father, picking at her vegetables while trying to maintain her usual "good girl" expression.</p>
<p>餐桌上弥漫着新蒸米饭的蒸汽和红烧肉的咸香。美悦子坐在爸爸对面，一边拨弄着蔬菜，一边努力维持她一贯的“乖女孩”表情。</p>
<p>"The market is just getting tougher these days," her father sighed, setting his chopsticks down for a moment to rub his temples. "That logistics company I’ve worked with for years is raising their rates again. It’s a headache."</p>
<p>“最近这生意是越来越难做了，”爸爸叹了口气，放下筷子揉了揉太阳穴，“合作好几年的那家物流公司又要涨价，真是让人头疼。”</p>
<p>"Again? They just raised them last spring," her mother remarked, placing a generous portion of meat into his bowl. "Eat more, dear. You've been looking tired lately."</p>
<p>“又涨？去年春天不是刚涨过吗，”妈妈说着，往他碗里夹了一大块肉，“多吃点，你最近看着挺累的。”</p>
<p>"It’s not just the costs," he continued, a typical daily grumble in his voice. "Clients are becoming more demanding. They want everything faster and cheaper. Sometimes I feel like I'm running on a treadmill that keeps speeding up."</p>
<p>“不光是成本问题，”他继续说道，语气里带着日常的牢骚，“客户也越来越挑剔，什么都要更快、更便宜。有时候我觉得自己就像跑在不断加速的跑步机上。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko listened, nodding sympathetically, but her mind was miles away. She looked at her father—a hardworking, ordinary man complaining about logistics and overheads—and then thought of Shiraishi's rough hands on her waist.</p>
<p>美悦子听着，同情地深表赞同，但她的心思早已飞到了几公里之外。她看着父亲——一个为物流和开支发牢骚的、勤恳平凡的男人，然后又想到白石那双掐在她腰上的粗糙的手。</p>
<p>The contrast was staggering. Here was the safe, slightly boring reality of adulthood, while just a few hours ago, she had explored a much more primal, electric side of being a "grown-up."</p>
<p>这种对比令人惊愕。这里是成年世界安全、甚至有点乏味的现实，而就在几个小时前，她刚刚探索了身为“成年人”更原始、更触电的一面。</p>
<p>"Are you listening, Miyetsuko? Don't end up in sales like your old man," her father joked, his eyes softening as he looked at her. "Study hard so you can have a comfortable office job with no stress."</p>
<p>“你在听吗，美悦子？以后可别像你老爸一样干销售，”爸爸开玩笑地说道，看向她的眼神变得柔和，“好好读书，以后找个舒服、没压力的办公室工作。”</p>
<p>"I'm listening, Dad," she replied with a soft laugh. "I'll do my best."</p>
<p>“我在听呢，爸爸，”她轻笑着回答，“我会努力的。”</p>
<p>She felt a strange sense of tenderness for his mundane worries. He worked so hard to keep this world stable and warm, never knowing that his daughter had already stepped into a fire that was anything but stable.</p>
<p>她对他那些平凡的烦恼感到一种奇特的温柔。他如此努力地维持着这个世界的稳定与温暖，却全然不知他的女儿已经踏入了一场绝不稳定的烈焰之中。</p>
