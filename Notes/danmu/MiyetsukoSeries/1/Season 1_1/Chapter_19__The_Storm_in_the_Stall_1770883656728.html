<p>Chapter 19: The Storm in the Stall</p>
<p>第 19 章：隔间里的风暴</p>
<p>Miyetsuko’s phone buzzed in her hand, the screen lighting up with Shiraishi’s reply: "Beautiful. I want you now." Before she could even process the words, the heavy outer door of the girls' restroom swung open with a muffled thud.</p>
<p>美悦子的手机在手里震动，屏幕亮起白石的回信：“太美了，我现在就想要你。”还没等她反应过来，女生洗手间沉重的大门便随着一声闷响被推开了。</p>
<p>Panic flared in her chest as she heard the unmistakable sound of heavy, hurried footsteps. The lock on her stall clicked again, but from the outside this time, as Shiraishi forced his way into the narrow space, shutting the world out behind him.</p>
<p>听到那沉重、急促且清晰的脚步声，她的胸口猛地炸开一阵恐慌。隔间的锁再次响起，但这次是从外面，白石强行闯入了这狭小的空间，将外面的世界彻底关在身后。</p>
<p>"Are you trying to drive me insane?" he growled, his eyes burning as they swept over her. The black lace was even more provocative in person, straining against her curves and framing the dark purple mark on her shoulder like a masterpiece of his own making.</p>
<p>“你是想让我疯掉吗？”他低吼道，灼热的目光扫过她的身体。这身黑色蕾丝在现实中比照片里更撩人，紧紧包裹着她的曲线，将她肩膀上那道深紫色印记勾勒得像他亲手完成的杰作。</p>
<p>He didn't wait for an answer. He slammed her back against the cold tile wall, his large hands immediately finding the delicate fabric. "You sent that photo knowing exactly what it would do to me, didn't you? You little brat."</p>
<p>他没有等她回答。他猛地将她按在冰冷的瓷砖墙上，宽大的双手立刻找到了那纤薄的布料。“你发那张照片，很清楚这会对我产生什么后果，对吧？你这个小坏种。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko gasped, her hands clutching his damp school blazer for balance. "I... I just wanted to show you," she whispered, her voice trembling. "I wanted to know if you liked it."</p>
<p>美悦子倒吸一口凉气，双手抓着他潮湿的校服西装以维持平衡。“我……我只是想给你看，”她颤声呢蓝道，“我想知道你喜不喜欢。”</p>
<p>"I don't just like it, I want to ruin it," Shiraishi hissed, his breath hot against her ear. He reached down, his fingers hooking into the lace and pulling it aside with a rough, impatient tug. "Look at you, all dressed up in my gift, acting like a good girl while you're hiding this under your uniform."</p>
<p>“我不只是喜欢，我简直想毁了它，”白石在她耳边嘶声道，呼吸灼热。他伸手向下，指尖勾住蕾丝，粗鲁而焦急地将其扯向一边。“瞧瞧你，穿着我送的礼物，穿着校服时装得像个乖女孩，底下却藏着这种东西。”</p>
<p>He entered her with a sudden, forceful thrust that made her head snap back against the wall. The narrow stall was filled with the sound of their colliding bodies and the frantic, rhythmic slapping of skin against skin.</p>
<p>他突然猛力挺身而入，让她的一下子撞在墙上。狭小的隔间里充斥着肉体碰撞的声音，以及皮肉拍打出的疯狂律动。</p>
<p>"Tell me, Miyetsuko," he groaned, his voice a raw, vibrating rumble. "Who do you belong to? When you're sitting in class acting all innocent, who is the one who really owns this body?"</p>
<p>“告诉我，美悦子，”他呻吟着，声音里透着原始而震颤的嘶吼，“你到底属于谁？当你坐在教室里装得一脸清纯时，到底谁才是这个身体的主人？”</p>
<p>"You... it's you, Shiraishi," she cried out, her eyes rolling back as she surrendered to the overwhelming heat. "Only you. Please, don't ever stop."</p>
<p>“你……是你，白石，”她叫了出来，在排山倒海般的热浪中仰起头彻底沦陷，“只有你。求你，永远别停下。”</p>
<p>The air in the stall grew thick and humid, the scent of their combined passion mixing with the faint smell of floor cleaner. In this forbidden space, amidst the "dirty talk" and the desperate friction, Miyetsuko felt a fierce, undeniable connection that no ordinary love could ever reach.</p>
<p>隔间里的空气变得浓重而潮湿，两人交织的激情气息与淡淡的地板清洁剂味道混合在一起。在这个禁忌的空间里，在那些“骚话”和疯狂的摩擦中，美悦子感受到了一种普通爱情永远无法企及的、猛烈且无可否认的羁绊。</p>
