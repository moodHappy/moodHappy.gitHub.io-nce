<p>Chapter 8: Convenience Store Rain</p>
<p>第 8 章：雨中的便利店</p>
<p>The sky turned a heavy, bruised purple before finally bursting open. A sudden downpour swept across the streets, turning the world into a gray blur of wind and water. Miyetsuko and Shiraishi, caught halfway home, scrambled into the nearest convenience store, their uniforms soaked and clinging to their skin.</p>
<p>天空在最终崩塌前变成了沉重的青紫色。突如其来的大雨席卷了街道，将世界变成了一片灰蒙蒙的风雨。走在回家路上的美悦子和白石被淋了个正着，他们仓促地躲进最近的便利店，校服湿透了，紧紧贴在皮肤上。</p>
<p>The bells above the door chimed a cheerful contrast to the chaotic storm outside. The air inside was cool and smelled of fried snacks and floor wax. Miyetsuko shivered, the damp fabric of her shirt sending a chill through her body, though her heart was still racing from the frantic run.</p>
<p>门上的风铃声响起，与外面混乱的暴雨形成了鲜明的对比。店里的空气很凉，弥漫着油炸小吃和地板蜡的味道。美悦子打了个冷颤，湿透的衬衫布料让她的身体感到一阵寒意，尽管她的心还在因为刚才的狂奔而剧烈跳动。</p>
<p>"Wait here," Shiraishi said, his voice dropping to that low, commanding tone she had grown to crave. He disappeared toward the back of the store and returned a moment later with two steaming cups of hot cocoa.</p>
<p>“在这等我，”白石说道，声音压低成了那种她愈发渴望的、带着命令感的语气。他走向商店后排，过了一会儿端着两杯冒着热气的热可可回来了。</p>
<p>He led her to a quiet corner behind a tall rack of magazines. As she took the cup, the warmth of the paper seeped into her cold palms, a soothing relief. She looked down and realized the laces on her left shoe had come completely undone during their dash through the rain.</p>
<p>他领着她走到一排高高的杂志架后的安静角落。当她接过杯子时，纸杯的温度渗入她冰冷的掌心，带来一种抚慰般的舒缓。她低头一看，发现左脚的鞋带在刚才冒雨狂奔时已经彻底散开了。</p>
<p>Before she could bend down, Shiraishi was already there. He dropped to one knee on the linoleum floor, his movements natural and unhesitating. Miyetsuko froze, her breath catching in her throat as she watched his large, calloused hands—the same hands that had gripped her so fiercely in the woods—now gently catch the loose laces.</p>
<p>还没等她弯腰，白石已经蹲了下去。他单膝跪在油毡地板上，动作自然而毫不犹豫。美悦子愣住了，呼吸滞在喉咙里，她看着他那双宽大、带着茧子的手——就是这双手，刚才在树林里还那么凶狠地抓着她——现在正温柔地牵起散落的鞋带。</p>
<p>He tied a neat, firm bow, his fingertips brushing against the damp fabric of her sock for a fleeting second. The intimacy of the gesture in such a mundane setting made Miyetsuko’s eyes sting with a sudden, overwhelming emotion. It was a simple act, but in that quiet corner with the rain drumming against the glass, it felt like the most profound confession he could ever make.</p>
<p>他打了一个整齐、牢固的蝴蝶结，指尖在飞逝的一秒钟里掠过她湿漉漉的袜尖。在这样一个平凡的场景下，这个亲昵的动作让美悦子的眼睛因为突然涌上来的强烈情感而微微发烫。这是一个简单的举动，但在暴雨敲打玻璃的安静角落里，这感觉就像是他能做出的最深沉的表白。</p>
<p>"There," he said softly, standing up and looking into her eyes. The raw intensity was still there, but it was tempered by a newfound softness that made her want to lean into him and never let go. "Don't trip on me now."</p>
<p>“好了，”他轻声说着，站起身直视她的眼睛。那种原始的炽热依然存在，但其中多了一份新生的温柔，让她想靠在他身上永远不松开。“现在别再被绊倒了。”</p>
