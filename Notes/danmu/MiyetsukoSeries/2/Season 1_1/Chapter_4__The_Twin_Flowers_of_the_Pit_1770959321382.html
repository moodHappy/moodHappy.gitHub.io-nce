<p>Chapter 4: The Twin Flowers of the Pit</p>
<p>第四章：坑中的并蒂花</p>
<p>Three months in Gokurakuzaka. In this neon-lit hell, time wasn't measured in days, but in the number of men who left their stains on the soul.</p>
<p>在极乐坂待了三个月。在这个霓虹闪烁的地狱里，时间不是按天计算的，而是按那些在灵魂上留下污渍的男人数量来衡量的。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko—Asset 107—had become a ghost in a machine of flesh. Her massive breasts, once a source of shame, were now her armor and her currency. They were permanently marked by the rough handling of the Pits, but she had learned to use their weight, to sway them like a hypnotic pendulum to distract the beasts while she retreated into the cold, dead spaces of her mind.</p>
<p>美悦子——107号资产——已经成了这台肉体机器中的幽灵。她那对巨大的乳房曾是羞耻的根源，现在却是她的盔甲和筹码。虽然在“地坑”的粗暴蹂躏下留下了永久的痕迹，但她已经学会了利用它们的重量，像催眠的钟摆一样晃动它们，在自己躲进冰冷、死寂的内心世界时，用来分散那些野兽的注意力。</p>
<p>The communal showers were the only place where the "assets" could see the sky—a small, barred square of grey high above the steam. It was here she met 209.</p>
<p>公共浴室是“资产”们唯一能看到天空的地方——那是蒸汽上方一个带铁栅栏的灰色小方块。就在这里，她遇到了209号。</p>
<p>The girl was small, delicate as a porcelain doll, her skin so pale it looked like moonlight. She was huddled in the corner of the cold spray, sobbing silently. On her collarbone, the fresh black ink screamed: 209.</p>
<p>那女孩很瘦小，像个精致的瓷娃娃，皮肤苍白得如同月光。她蜷缩在冷水喷头下的角落里，无声地啜泣着。在她锁骨上，鲜红的黑色墨迹正刺眼地叫嚣着：209。</p>
<p>"Stop crying," Miyetsuko said, her voice like gravel. "The water is cold enough. Your tears won't warm it."</p>
<p>“别哭了，”美悦子的声音沙哑得像碎石。“水够冷了，你的眼泪暖不了它。”</p>
<p>The girl looked up. Her eyes were wide, filled with a terror Miyetsuko knew too well. This was Hananoi.</p>
<p>女孩抬起头。她的眼睛很大，充满了美悦子再熟悉不过的恐惧。她叫花乃井。</p>
<p>"I... I can't," Hananoi whispered. "The man before... he was so heavy. I thought my ribs would snap. Is it always like this?"</p>
<p>“我……我受不了了，”花乃井低声说。“刚才那个男人……他太重了。我以为我的肋骨要断了。一直都是这样吗？”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko walked over, her own monstrous chest swaying with every step, a stark contrast to Hananoi’s fragile frame. She reached out a bruised hand and tilted Hananoi’s chin up.</p>
<p>美悦子走了过去，每走一步，她那对巨乳都随之晃动，与花乃井脆弱的身架形成了鲜明的对比。她伸出一只布满淤青的手，托起花乃井的下巴。</p>
<p>"It gets worse," Miyetsuko said bluntly. "Kurosaki Soichiro doesn't send people here to live. He sends them here to be used until the gears grind to a halt. We are just the grease for his empire."</p>
<p>“只会更糟，”美悦子直截了当地说。“黑崎宗一郎把人送到这儿不是为了让人活命的。他把我们送来，是让我们被用到齿轮磨停为止。我们只是他帝国的润滑油。”</p>
<p>At the mention of Kurosaki’s name, Hananoi flinched. "He... he signed my papers personally. He smiled when he told me I was 'premium quality' for the Pits."</p>
<p>听到黑崎的名字，花乃井瑟缩了一下。“他……他亲手签了我的文件。他告诉我我是地坑里的‘极品’时，还在笑。”</p>
<p>"He smiles at everyone he destroys," Miyetsuko sneered. "Listen to me, 209. In this place, you are no longer Hananoi. You are a number. If you want to survive, you have to kill the girl inside you. Don't feel the pain. Don't smell the filth. Become a doll. A doll in a box."</p>
<p>“他对他毁灭的每个人都会笑，”美悦子冷笑一声。“听着，209号。在这个地方，你不再是花乃井。你只是个数字。如果你想活下去，你就必须杀掉你内心的那个女孩。不要去感受痛苦，不要去闻那些污秽。变成一个玩偶。一个盒子里的玩偶。”</p>
<p>She grabbed Hananoi’s small hand and pressed it against her own heavy, scarred breast.</p>
<p>她抓起花乃井的小手，按在自己那对沉重、布满伤痕的乳房上。</p>
<p>"Feel this? This is what Kurosaki wants. He wants us to be meat. But meat doesn't have a soul. And if you have no soul, they can't break you."</p>
<p>“感觉到了吗？这就是黑崎想要的。他想要我们变成肉。但肉是没有灵魂的。如果你没有灵魂，他们就无法击垮你。”</p>
<p>From that day on, an odd alliance formed in the darkness of Gokurakuzaka. Miyetsuko became Hananoi’s mentor—the teacher of the macabre.</p>
<p>从那天起，在极乐坂的黑暗中，一种奇异的同盟形成了。美悦子成了花乃井的导师——死亡艺术的教师。</p>
<p>During the brief, ten-minute breaks between clients, they would lean against the cold concrete walls, sharing a single cigarette or a cup of lukewarm water. Miyetsuko taught her the tricks: how to breathe to avoid the stench, how to tense the muscles to minimize internal tearing, and how to use her eyes to look through a man without ever seeing him.</p>
<p>在客人的十分钟休息间隙，她们会靠在冰冷的混凝土墙上，共抽一支烟，或共饮一杯温水。美悦子教她技巧：如何通过呼吸避开臭味，如何收紧肌肉以减轻内部撕裂，以及如何用眼神穿透一个男人而不真正看到他。</p>
<p>But the shadow of the boss was never far away.</p>
<p>但那位大老板的阴影从未远离。</p>
<p>"I heard the Overseer talking," Hananoi whispered one night, her head resting on Miyetsuko’s shoulder. The "Overseer" was a cruel woman named Madame Tachibana, a former worker who had clawed her way up by stepping on the backs of others. "She said Kurosaki is coming to inspect the 'yield' next month. He wants to see if the Pits are efficient."</p>
<p>“我听到监工说话了，”一天晚上，花乃井把头枕在美悦子的肩膀上低声说道。“监工”是一个叫橘夫人的残忍女人，她曾是个妓女，通过踩着别人的背爬了上来。“她说黑崎下个月要来视察‘产量’。他想看看地坑的效率如何。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko’s grip tightened on Hananoi’s arm. The name Kurosaki acted like an electric shock to her system.</p>
<p>美悦子抓着花乃井手臂的手猛然收紧。“黑崎”这个名字对她的神经系统来说就像一次电击。</p>
<p>"Let him come," Miyetsuko hissed. "Let him see what he’s created."</p>
<p>“让他来吧，”美悦子嘶声说道。“让他看看他创造了什么。”</p>
<p>Just then, the plastic curtain of their shared break-area was ripped aside. It was Madame Tachibana, her face a mask of heavy makeup and ancient malice.</p>
<p>就在这时，她们共用休息区的塑料帘子被猛地拉开。是橘夫人，她那张脸像是一副由浓妆和陈年恶意构成的面具。</p>
<p>"What is this? A tea party?" Tachibana barked, her eyes darting between the massive, exposed chest of 107 and the fragile beauty of 209. "107, you have a special request. A group of three. They want to see if the rumors about those 'monstrous udders' are true. And 209, get back to your cell. A regular is waiting, and he’s in a bad mood."</p>
<p>“这是干什么？茶话会吗？”橘夫人吼道，目光在107号那对巨大的、裸露的胸脯和209号脆弱的美貌之间来回扫视。“107号，你有特殊点名。三个人一组。他们想看看关于那对‘怪物奶子’的传闻是不是真的。209号，滚回你的牢房。有个熟客在等着，他心情可不太好。”</p>
<p>She stepped closer, poking a long, sharp fingernail into the "107" mark on Miyetsuko’s breast.</p>
<p>她走近一步，用修长尖锐的指甲戳进美悦子乳房上的“107”标记。</p>
<p>"Don't get too close, little bird," Tachibana sneered at Hananoi. "This one is a monster. Kurosaki-sama designed her to be broken, not to be a friend."</p>
<p>“别靠得太近，小鸟儿，”橘夫人对花乃井冷笑道。“这只是个怪物。黑崎大人设计她是为了让她被玩坏的，而不是让她来交朋友的。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko didn't flinch. She stood up, her giant breasts swaying with a heavy, dangerous rhythm. She looked Tachibana straight in the eye.</p>
<p>美悦子没有退缩。她站起身，巨大的乳房随着沉重而危险的节奏晃动。她直视着橘夫人的眼睛。</p>
<p>"I'm going," Miyetsuko said, her voice devoid of emotion.</p>
<p>“我这就去，”美悦子的声音里毫无感情。</p>
<p>As she walked past Hananoi, she whispered just loud enough for only the girl to hear:</p>
<p>当她走过花乃井身边时，她低声说道，声音恰好只够那女孩听见：</p>
<p>"Remember, 209. The box is only temporary. One day, the doll is going to bite back."</p>
<p>“记住，209号。盒子只是暂时的。总有一天，玩偶会反咬一口。”</p>
<p>接下来，你想描写美悦子如何应对那场残暴的“三人点名”，并在绝境中保护花乃井？还是让她们在极乐坂的底层发现某种能够反制黑崎的秘密？</p>
