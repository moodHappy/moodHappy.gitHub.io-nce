<p>第二十四章：白西装上的血</p>
<p>Silence returned to the warehouse. Dust settled on the bodies.</p>
<p>寂静回到了仓库。灰尘落在尸体上。</p>
<p>Fantasma crawled out from under a table, shaking. "Madre de Dios... you people are insane."</p>
<p>幽灵从桌子底下爬出来，发抖。“上帝啊……你们这群人是疯子。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko jumped down from the forklift. Her white suit was ruined—torn at the shoulder, stained black with grease and red with blood splatter.</p>
<p>美悦子从叉车上跳下来。她的白西装毁了——肩膀撕裂，沾满了黑色的油污和红色的血点。</p>
<p>She walked over to Chen Mo.</p>
<p>她走向陈默。</p>
<p>He was leaning against the container, breathing heavily. A bullet had grazed his arm; blood was soaking his black shirt.</p>
<p>他靠在集装箱上，呼吸沉重。一颗子弹擦伤了他的手臂；血浸透了他的黑衬衫。</p>
<p>"You're bleeding," she touched his arm. Her fingers came away red.</p>
<p>“你流血了，”她碰了碰他的手臂。手指染红了。</p>
<p>"Just a scratch," Chen Mo shrugged. "But your suit is ruined."</p>
<p>“擦伤而已，”陈默耸耸肩。“但你的西装毁了。”</p>
<p>"I don't care about the suit," she grabbed his collar and pulled him down.</p>
<p>“我不在乎西装，”她抓住他的领子把他拉下来。</p>
<p>She kissed him. Hard. It was a kiss of possession, of relief, of adrenaline. She tasted the dust on his lips and the iron in the air.</p>
<p>她吻了他。狠狠地。这是一个占有的吻，解脱的吻，肾上腺素的吻。她尝到了他嘴唇上的灰尘和空气中的铁锈味。</p>
<p>Fantasma watched them, dumbfounded. Two killers, covered in filth and blood, making out in a graveyard of mercenaries.</p>
<p>幽灵目瞪口呆地看着他们。两个杀手，满身污垢和鲜血，在雇佣兵的坟场里激吻。</p>
<p>"You are my shield, Chen," she whispered against his lips, her hand sliding down to cup him through his pants. "And my sword. And my..."</p>
<p>“你是我的盾，陈，”她在他唇边低语，手向下滑，隔着裤子握住了他。“也是我的剑。还有我的……”</p>
<p>"Your partner," Chen Mo finished for her, kissing the blood on her cheek. "Always."</p>
<p>“你的搭档，”陈默替她说完，吻掉她脸颊上的血。“永远。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko turned to Fantasma, her arm still around Chen Mo's waist, supporting him—and claiming him.</p>
<p>美悦子转向幽灵，手臂依然搂着陈默的腰，支撑着他——也宣示着主权。</p>
<p>"Clean this up, Fantasma. And double the security. The war has just begun."</p>
<p>“把这儿清理干净，幽灵。安保加倍。战争才刚刚开始。”</p>
<p>She looked at Chen Mo.</p>
<p>她看着陈默。</p>
<p>"Let's go home. I need to lick your wounds."</p>
<p>“我们回家。我要去舔你的伤口。”</p></div>
