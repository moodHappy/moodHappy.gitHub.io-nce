<p>第五十七章：握手</p>
<p>Mishima recovered quickly. He was a shark, after all.</p>
<p>三岛恢复得很快。毕竟他是条鲨鱼。</p>
<p>"Mrs. Kurosaki," he forced a smile, stepping down from the stage. "What a... pleasant surprise. We thought you were in Rio."</p>
<p>“黑崎夫人，”他挤出一个笑，走下舞台。“真是……惊喜。我们以为你在里约。”</p>
<p>"I was," she smiled back. She extended her hand. She wasn't wearing gloves.</p>
<p>“我是在那儿，”她回以微笑。她伸出手。没戴手套。</p>
<p>Mishima took her hand. He expected it to be cold. But it was warm. Alive.</p>
<p>三岛握住她的手。他以为会是冰冷的。但它是温暖的。鲜活的。</p>
<p>He leaned in close, for a hug that looked friendly to the cameras but was a threat.</p>
<p>他凑近，给了一个在镜头前看起来友好但实则是威胁的拥抱。</p>
<p>"You survived The Butcher," he whispered in her ear. "Impressive. But you are in Tokyo now. My city."</p>
<p>“你在屠夫手里活下来了，”他在她耳边低语。“令人印象深刻。但你现在在东京。我的城市。”</p>
<p>"Your city?" Miyetsuko whispered back, her hand resting lightly on his chest, right over his heart. "I brought the jungle with me, Mishima. Check your stock price."</p>
<p>“你的城市？”美悦子低语回去，手轻轻放在他胸口，就在心脏的位置。“我把丛林带回来了，三岛。看看你的股价。”</p>
<p>She pulled away, smiling for the cameras.</p>
<p>她推开他，对着镜头微笑。</p>
<p>"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a board meeting to crash. My assistant, Mr. Chen, has the paperwork."</p>
<p>“现在，失陪了，我有个董事会要砸场子。我的助理，陈先生，拿着文件。”</p>
<p>She turned and walked away.</p>
<p>她转身离开。</p>
<p>Chen Mo stepped forward. He didn't smile. He stared at Mishima with dead eyes, dropped a heavy file onto the podium, and followed his Queen.</p>
<p>陈默走上前。没笑。他用死寂的眼神盯着三岛，把一份厚厚的文件扔在讲台上，然后跟随他的女王离开。</p>
<p>As they walked out, Mishima looked at his phone.</p>
<p>当他们走出去时，三岛看了一眼手机。</p>
<p>His face went pale.</p>
<p>他的脸白了。</p>
