<p>第二十八章：代码游戏</p>
<p>"What game?" The Russian asked, his voice like grinding stones.</p>
<p>“什么游戏？”俄罗斯人问，声音像磨石。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko took out her tablet.</p>
<p>美悦子拿出平板电脑。</p>
<p>"Currently, there are three shipments waiting at customs. One belongs to you, Colombian. Cocaine. Value: 20 million. One belongs to you, Russian. Assault rifles. Value: 15 million. And one..." she looked at Fantasma, "...is just bananas."</p>
<p>“目前，海关有三批货物在等待。一批是你的，哥伦比亚人。可卡因。价值：2000万。一批是你的，俄罗斯人。突击步枪。价值：1500万。还有一批……”她看着幽灵，“……是香蕉。”</p>
<p>"I can clear one shipment right now. The other two... get flagged for inspection by the Federal Police. Immediate seizure."</p>
<p>“我现在可以放行一批。另外两批……会被标记给联邦警察进行检查。立即扣押。”</p>
<p>She placed the tablet in the center of the table.</p>
<p>她把平板放在桌子中央。</p>
<p>"Bid for it. Not with money. But with territory."</p>
<p>“竞价吧。不用钱。用底盘。”</p>
<p>"You are bluffing," The Butcher sneered. He reached out his hairy hand to grab her wrist. "I take the tablet, I take the codes, and I take you."</p>
<p>“你在虚张声势，”屠夫冷笑。他伸出毛茸茸的手去抓她的手腕。“我抢走平板，抢走代码，再抢走你。”</p>
<p>Before his hand could touch her silk sleeve—</p>
<p>在他的手碰到她的丝绸袖子之前——</p>
<p>CRACK.</p>
<p>咔嚓。</p>
<p>Chen Mo moved.</p>
<p>陈默动了。</p>
<p>He didn't stand up. He didn't draw a gun. He simply grabbed The Butcher's finger—the index finger pointing at Miyetsuko—and snapped it backwards 90 degrees.</p>
<p>他没站起来。也没拔枪。他只是抓住了屠夫的手指——那根指着美悦子的食指——然后向后折了90度。</p>
<p>"AHHHHHH!" The Butcher screamed, falling to his knees.</p>
<p>“啊！！！！”屠夫惨叫，跪倒在地。</p>
<p>His bodyguards drew their guns.</p>
<p>Chen Mo's other hand was already holding a pistol under the table, aimed directly at The Butcher's crotch.</p>
<p>屠夫的保镖拔枪。</p>
<p>陈默的另一只手已经在桌下握着枪，直指屠夫的裤裆。</p>
<p>"Sit down," Chen Mo said softly. His voice was calm, like a librarian shushing a noisy patron.</p>
<p>“坐下，”陈默轻声说。他的声音很平静，像图书管理员在让吵闹的读者安静。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko didn't even look at the screaming man. She opened her lace fan and gently fanned herself, the breeze blowing a few strands of hair across Chen Mo's face.</p>
<p>美悦子甚至没看那个惨叫的男人。她打开蕾丝扇子，轻轻给自己扇风，微风吹动几缕发丝拂过陈默的脸。</p>
<p>"My pet is protective," she smiled at the Russian. "Now, Nikolai. Do you want your guns? Or do you want to lose a finger too?"</p>
<p>“我的宠物护主心切，”她对着俄罗斯人笑。“现在，尼古拉。你是想要你的枪？还是也想丢根手指？”</p></div>
