<p>第四十章：方向盘女王</p>
<p>The tactical suit was hot. The Kevlar vest was tight. As Miyetsuko wrestled with the heavy steering of the Land Rover, she felt sweat trickling down her spine, pooling at the base of her back inside the suit.</p>
<p>战术服很热。凯夫拉背心很紧。当美悦子与路虎沉重的转向搏斗时，她感觉到汗水顺着脊椎流下，汇聚在紧身衣里的后腰处。</p>
<p>Four dirt bikes buzzed around them like angry hornets. The riders carried Uzis.</p>
<p>四辆越野摩托像愤怒的大黄蜂一样围着他们嗡嗡作响。骑手拿着乌兹冲锋枪。</p>
<p>Glass shattered. A bullet whizzed past her nose and embedded itself in the dashboard.</p>
<p>玻璃碎裂。一颗子弹擦过她的鼻子，嵌进了仪表盘。</p>
<p>"Take the wheel!" she screamed.</p>
<p>“掌舵！”她尖叫。</p>
<p>"What?" Chen Mo looked at her.</p>
<p>“什么？”陈默看着她。</p>
<p>"I said take the wheel! I need to shoot!"</p>
<p>“我说掌舵！我要开枪！”</p>
<p>Without slowing down, she unbuckled her seatbelt. She pushed her tactical boot down on the accelerator, locking it.</p>
<p>没有减速，她解开了安全带。她把战术靴踩在油门上，锁死油门。</p>
<p>Then, she climbed over the center console.</p>
<p>然后，她爬过了中控台。</p>
<p>For a second, she was straddling the gear stick, her crotch inches from Chen Mo's arm. The smell of her pheromones—fear, sweat, and arousal—filled the cabin.</p>
<p>有一秒钟，她跨坐在档把上，胯部离陈默的手臂只有几英寸。她的费洛蒙——恐惧、汗水和兴奋——充满了车厢。</p>
<p>Chen Mo grabbed the wheel with his left hand to keep them on the road.</p>
<p>陈默用左手抓住方向盘，保持车辆在路上。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko climbed into the back seat. She kicked the rear window out.</p>
<p>美悦子爬到了后座。她踢飞了后挡风玻璃。</p>
<p>She pulled the two Glocks from her thigh holsters.</p>
<p>她从大腿枪套里拔出那两把格洛克。</p>
<p>The wind roared into the cabin. She stood up in the back of the speeding SUV, her black-clad form silhouetted against the favela lights.</p>
<p>风咆哮着灌进车厢。她在飞驰的SUV后座站了起来，黑色的身影映衬着贫民窟的灯火。</p>
<p>"Come get me, you dogs!" she screamed into the night.</p>
<p>“来抓我啊，你们这群狗！”她对着夜空尖叫。</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>砰！砰！砰！砰！</p>
<p>She fired with both hands. Akimbo style. It was reckless. It was cinema. It was pure release.</p>
<p>她双手开火。双持射击。这是鲁莽的。是电影般的。是纯粹的释放。</p>
<p>One biker took a bullet to the chest and flew off his bike. Another skidded on the oil slick and crashed into a wall.</p>
<p>一个骑手胸部中弹飞出摩托。另一个在油渍上打滑撞墙。</p>
<p>She dropped back into the seat, breathless, her chest heaving against the tight armor.</p>
<p>她跌回座位，喘不过气，胸口剧烈撞击着紧身护甲。</p>
<p>"I got two!" she yelled at Chen Mo.</p>
<p>“我干掉了两个！”她对陈默大喊。</p>
<p>"There's a roadblock ahead!" Chen Mo shouted back. "Hold on!"</p>
<p>“前面有路障！”陈默喊回去。“抓紧！”</p>
<p>He yanked the wheel. The Land Rover smashed through a wooden fence and went airborne.</p>
<p>他猛打方向盘。路虎撞碎了一道木栅栏，腾空而起。</p>
<p>They flew over a flight of stone stairs, landing hard on the lower street. The suspension groaned, but held.</p>
<p>他们飞过一段石阶，重重落在下方的街道上。悬挂系统发出呻吟，但撑住了。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko tumbled forward, crashing into the back of Chen Mo's seat.</p>
<p>美悦子向前滚去，撞在陈默的椅背上。</p>
<p>"Are you alive?" Chen Mo asked, swerving to avoid a stray dog.</p>
<p>“还活着吗？”陈默问，急转弯避开一条流浪狗。</p>
<p>"I'm alive," she laughed. She crawled forward, pressing her face against the back of his neck, licking the sweat there. "And I'm never wearing white silk again. Only black. Only armor."</p>
<p>“活着，”她大笑。她向前爬，脸贴在他的后颈上，舔舐那里的汗水。“我再也不穿白丝绸了。只穿黑色。只穿盔甲。”</p></div>
