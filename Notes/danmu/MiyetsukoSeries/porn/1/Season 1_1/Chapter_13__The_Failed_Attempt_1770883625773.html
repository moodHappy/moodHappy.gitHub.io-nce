<p>Chapter 13: The Failed Attempt</p>
<p>第 13 章：失败的尝试</p>
<p>Shiraishi shifted his weight on the gym mats, pressing the heat of his desire against her trembling lips. "Now," he commanded, his voice thick with the anticipation of her "homework" results. "Show me what you learned last night."</p>
<p>白石在体育垫上移动了一下重心，将他那股炽热的欲望压在她颤抖的唇边。“现在，”他命令道，声音里透着对他“作业”成果的浓厚期待。“向我证明你昨晚学到了什么。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko took a shaky breath, her eyes fluttering shut as she leaned forward. She tentatively opened her mouth and took him in, trying to recall the rhythm and the softness she had practiced in the privacy of her room. But the reality was far more overwhelming than any fruit.</p>
<p>美悦子颤抖着吸了口气，闭上眼睛凑上前去。她试探着张开嘴含了进去，努力回想起自己在房间私下练习时的那种律动和柔软。但现实比任何水果都更让她难以招架。</p>
<p>In her intense nervousness, her jaw tensed. As she moved, her teeth accidentally grazed the most sensitive part of him. Shiraishi let out a sharp, pained hiss and recoiled instantly, his hands gripping her shoulders a bit too hard.</p>
<p>在极度的紧张中，她的下颌变得僵硬。随着动作，她的牙齿不小心蹭到了他最敏感的地方。白石猛地倒吸一口凉气，发出痛苦的嘶声并瞬间缩了回来，双手死死按住她的肩膀，力道大得有些过头。</p>
<p>"Ow! Watch the teeth, Miyetsuko!" he barked, the raw aggression in his voice momentarily replaced by genuine irritation. The electric atmosphere in the storage room cooled slightly as he stared down at her, his brow furrowed in frustration.</p>
<p>“嗷！注意牙齿，美悦子！”他吼道，声音里那种原始的侵略感瞬间被真实的恼怒所取代。随着他低头盯着她，眉头因沮丧而紧锁，器材室里触电般的氛围稍微冷却了一些。</p>
<p>Miyetsuko pulled back, her face flushing a shade of crimson that bordered on purple. "I... I'm sorry. I told you I wasn't ready," she whispered, her voice small and filled with genuine apology. The confidence she had built up during her solo practice had vanished in a single second.</p>
<p>美悦子退后了些，脸红得近乎发紫。“我……对不起。我说了我还没准备好，”她小声嘀咕着，声音细微，充满了真诚的歉意。她独自练习时建立起的那点信心在一秒钟内烟消云散。</p>
<p>Shiraishi let out a long, heavy sigh, looking at the ceiling as he tried to regain his composure. He realized that a single night with a banana couldn't replace the experience needed for the real thing. "Forget it," he muttered, shaking his head. "Let's give it a rest. We're clearly not getting anywhere with that today."</p>
<p>白石长长地叹了口气，盯着天花板努力恢复冷静。他意识到，对着香蕉练一晚并不能取代实战所需的经验。“算了，”他咕哝着摇了摇头。“先停下吧。今天显然没法继续这个了。”</p>
<p>He let go of her shoulders and stepped back, the frustration still visible in his eyes, but his gaze softened when he saw how truly upset she looked. He wasn't going to push her into something that was causing them both pain.</p>
<p>他松开了她的肩膀往后退了一步，眼神中依然透着沮丧，但看到她那副真切受挫的模样，他的目光又柔和了下来。他不想强迫她做一件会让双方都感到痛苦的事。</p>
