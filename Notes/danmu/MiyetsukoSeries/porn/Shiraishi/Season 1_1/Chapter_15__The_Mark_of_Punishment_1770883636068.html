<p>Chapter 15: The Mark of Punishment</p>
<p>第 15 章：惩罚的印记</p>
<p>As they lay tangled on the mats, Shiraishi suddenly leaned down. His breath was hot against her neck, but instead of a soft kiss, he sank his teeth into the tender skin of her shoulder. He bit down with a deliberate, firm pressure, holding it just long enough for the sensation to sting.</p>
<p>当他们纠缠着躺在垫子上时，白石突然俯下身。他的呼吸炽热地喷在她的脖颈上，但这次不是温柔的亲吻，他将牙齿深深嵌入了她肩膀娇嫩的皮肤里。他故意用力咬了下去，力道沉稳而果断，停留的时间刚好让那份刺痛感变得清晰。</p>
<p>"This is your punishment," he growled against her skin, his voice vibrating through her entire body. "For failing your homework. I told you I was looking forward to it, didn't I?"</p>
<p>“这是对你的惩罚，”他在她皮肤上低吼，声音震动着她的全身。“惩罚你没完成作业。我说了我很期待的，不是吗？”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko let out a small, sharp gasp, her back arching slightly. She could feel the raw, throbbing heat where his teeth had been. He pulled back, his thumb tracing the angry red crescent mark that stood out vividly against her snowy skin.</p>
<p>美悦子发出了一声短促而尖锐的娇吟，背部微微张起。她能感觉到刚才被他咬过的地方正散发着阵阵火辣辣的跳痛。他退后了些，大拇指抚摸着那道在雪白皮肤上显得格外显眼的、鲜红的月牙形齿痕。</p>
<p>"Now you'll remember every time you look in the mirror," Shiraishi said, his eyes dark with a possessive pride. "Until next time, when you show me you’ve actually been practicing."</p>
<p>“现在你每次照镜子都会想起来了，”白石说着，眼神中透着一股占有欲十足的自豪，“直到下次，你向我证明你确实有在好好练习为止。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko touched the mark tentatively, her fingers trembling. It stung, but a strange, sweet thrill blossomed in her chest. It wasn't just a punishment; it was a brand. To her, that mark was a trophy—a visible sign that he wanted her so much he couldn't help but leave a piece of himself on her.</p>
<p>美悦子试探着摸了摸那道印记，指尖在发抖。虽然很疼，但一股奇特而甜滋滋的悸动在胸中绽放。这不不仅仅是惩罚，更是一个烙印。对她来说，这印记像是个战利品——一个显眼的信号，证明他如此渴望她，以至于忍不住要在她身上留下属于他的痕迹。</p>
<p>"It's so deep," she whispered, a shy, secret smile playing on her lips. "Everyone will wonder what happened."</p>
<p>“咬得好深，”她轻声呢喃，嘴角挂着一丝羞涩又隐秘的笑，“大家都会好奇发生了什么的。”</p>
<p>"Let them wonder," Shiraishi smirked, standing up and pulling his uniform back together. "As long as you know who put it there, that's all that matters."</p>
<p>“让他们好奇去吧，”白石坏笑着站起身，整理好校服，“只要你知道是谁弄上去的，那就足够了。”</p>
<p>Miyetsuko stood up too, her legs still feeling like jelly. She carefully adjusted her bra strap so it sat right next to the mark, the lace scratching it just enough to keep the memory of his teeth fresh. She felt marked, claimed, and strangely cherished.</p>
<p>美悦子也站了起来，双腿依然像面条一样发软。她小心地调整了胸罩带子，让它刚好贴在印记旁，蕾丝的轻微摩擦让那份被咬的记忆始终鲜活。她感觉到自己被标记了，被占有了，而且奇妙地被珍视着。</p>
