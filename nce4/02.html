<p>Lesson 2 Spare that spider不要伤害蜘蛛</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>Why, you may wonder, should spiders be our friends?</p>
<p>你可能会觉得奇怪， 蜘蛛怎么会是我们的朋友呢？</p>
<p>Because they destroy so many insects, and insects include some of the greatest enemies of the human race.</p>
<p>因为它们能消灭那么多的昆虫，其中包括一些人类的大敌。</p>
<p>Insects would make it impossible for us to live in the world; they would devour all our crops and kill our flocks and herds, if it were not for the protection we get from insect-eating animals.</p>
<p>昆虫就会使我们无法在地球上生活下去，昆虫会吞食我们的全部庄稼，杀死我们的成群的牛羊，要不是人类受一些食虫动物的保护，</p>
<p>We owe a lot to the birds and beasts who eat insects but all of them put together kill only a fraction of the number destroyed by spiders.</p>
<p>我们要十分感谢那些吃昆虫的鸟和兽，然而把它们所杀死的昆虫全部加在一起也只相当于蜘蛛所消灭的一小部分。</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike some of the other insect eaters, spiders never do the least harm to us or our belongings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>此外，蜘蛛不同于其他食虫动物，它们丝毫不危害我们和我们的财物。</p>
<p>Spiders are not insects, as many people think, nor even nearly related to them.</p>
<p>许多人认为蜘蛛是昆虫，但它们不是昆虫，甚至与昆虫毫无关系。</p>
<p>One can tell the difference almost at a glance, for a spider always has eight legs and an insect never more than six.</p>
<p>人们几乎一眼就能看出二者的差异，因为蜘蛛都是8条腿，而昆虫的腿从不超过6条。</p>
<p>How many spiders are engaged in this work on our behalf?</p>
<p>有多少蜘蛛在为我们效力呢？</p>
<p>One authority on spiders made a census of the spiders in a grass field in the south of England, and he estimated that there were more than 2,250,000 in one acre; that is something like 6 million spiders of different kinds on a football pitch.</p>
<p>一位研究蜘蛛的权威对英国南部一块草坪上的蜘蛛作了一次调查，他估计每英亩草坪里有225万多只蜘蛛，这就是说，在一个足球场上约有600万只不同种类的蜘蛛。</p>
<p>Spiders are busy for at least half the year in killing insects.</p>
<p>蜘蛛至少有半年在忙于吃昆虫。</p>
<p>It is impossible to make more than the wildest guess at how many they kill, but they are hungry creatures, not content with only three meals a day.</p>
<p>它们一年中消灭了多少昆虫，我们简直无法猜测，它们是吃不饱的动物，不满意一日三餐。</p>
<p>It has been estimated that the weight of all the insects destroyed by spiders in Britain in one year would be greater than the total weight of all the human beings in the country.</p>
<p>据估计，在英国蜘蛛一年里所消灭昆虫的重量超过这个国家人口的总重量。</p>

<p>知识点（1-1）复习Lesson03-33</p>
<p>语法复习：非限定性定语从句</p>
<p>课文举例：</p>
<p>Things can go wrong on a big scale, as （关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做discovered的宾语） a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney.</p>
<p>As （关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做explained的宾语） the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!</p>
<p>If, as（关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做主语） has been reported, they have protected humans from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks.</p>
<p>As（关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做主语） is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil.</p>
<p>【辨析】</p>
<p>语法：as 引导的非限定性定语从句与 which 引导的非限定性定语从句的区别。</p>
<p>1、as 作为关系代词指代整个主句，而 which 作为关系代词指代整个主句或先行词均可。</p>
<p>2、as 引导的非限定性定语从句位于主句前、中、后均可，而which 引导的非限定性定语从句不能位于主句之前。</p>
<p>As a poet points out, life is but a dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children, as is always the case, love their mother.</p>
<p>She became angry, as many could see.</p>
<p>3、as 引导的非限定性定语从句含有&ldquo;众所周知&rdquo;的意思，常译为&ldquo;正如&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;，而which 引导的非限定性定语从句则未必有这个意思。</p>
<p>The sun heats the earth, which makes it possible for plants to grow.（不能换成as，没有&ldquo;正如&rdquo;的含义）</p>
<p>4、在&ldquo;as + is/was + done&rdquo;结构中可省略&ldquo;is/was&rdquo;，而在 &ldquo;which + is/was + done&rdquo;可省略&ldquo;which + is/was&rdquo;，而不能只省略 be 动词。</p>
<p>As (is) reported, a foreign delegation will visit the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a puma (which was) at large&nbsp;</p>
<p>托福语法改错题：</p>
<p>As Napoleon once pointed it out, attack is the best method of defense. X多了宾语 （美式认为错误）（英式中认为可以接受，as充当连词，不错宾语）</p>
