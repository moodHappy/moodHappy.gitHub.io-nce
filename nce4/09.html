<p>Lesson 9 Royal espionage 王室谍报活动</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>Alfred the Great acted as his own spy, visiting Danish camps disguised as a minstrel.</p>
<p>阿尔弗雷德大帝曾亲自充当间谍，扮作吟游歌手到丹麦军队的营地里侦察。</p>
<p>In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere.</p>
<p>当时，浪迹天涯的吟游歌手到处受欢迎。</p>
<p>They were not fighting men, and their harp was their passport.</p>
<p>他们不是作战人员，竖琴就是他们的通行证。</p>
<p>Alfred had learned many of their ballads in his youth and could vary his programme with acrobatic tricks and simple conjuring.</p>
<p>阿尔弗德年轻时学过许多民歌，并能穿插演一些杂技和小魔术使自己的节目多样化。</p>
<p>While Alfred's little army slowly began to gather at Athelney, the king himself set out to penetrate the camp of Guthrum, the commander of the Danish invaders.</p>
<p>阿尔弗雷德人数不多的军队开始在阿塞尔纳慢慢集结时，他亲自潜入丹麦入侵司令官古瑟罗姆的营地。</p>
<p>These had settled down for the winter at Chippenham: thither Alfred went.</p>
<p>丹麦军已在切本哈姆扎下营准备过冬，阿尔弗雷便来到此地。</p>
<p>He noticed at once that discipline was slack: the Danes had the self-confidence of conquerors, and their security precautions were casual.</p>
<p>他马上发现丹麦军纪律松弛，他们以征服者自居，安全措施马马虎虎。</p>
<p>They lived well, on the proceeds of raids on neighbouring regions.</p>
<p>他们靠掠夺附近的地区的财物过着舒适的生活。</p>
<p>There they collected women as well as food and drink, and a life of ease had made them soft.</p>
<p>他们不仅搜刮吃的喝的，而且抢掠妇女，安逸的生活已使丹麦军队变得软弱无力。</p>
<p>Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney.</p>
<p>阿尔弗雷德在敌营呆了一个星期后，回到了阿塞尔纳。</p>
<p>The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish horde.</p>
<p>他集结在那里的军队和丹麦大军相比是微不足道的，</p>
<p>But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for prolonged battle: and that their commissariat had no organization, but depended on irregular raids.</p>
<p>然而，阿尔弗雷德断定，丹麦人已不再适应持久的战争，他们的军需供应处于无组织状态，只是靠临时抢夺来维持。</p>
<p>So, faced with the Danish advance, Alfred did not risk open battle but harried the enemy.</p>
<p>因此，面对丹麦人的进攻，阿尔弗雷德没有贸然同敌人作战，而是采用骚扰敌人的战术。</p>
<p>He was constantly on the move, drawing the Danes after him.</p>
<p>他的部队不停地移动，牵着敌人的鼻子，让他们跟着跑。</p>
<p>His patrols halted the raiding parties: hunger assailed the Danish army.</p>
<p>他派出巡逻队阻止敌人抢劫，因而饥饿威胁着丹麦军队。</p>
<p>Now Alfred began a long series of skirmishes -- and within a month the Danes had surrendered.</p>
<p>这时，阿尔弗雷德发起一连串小规模的进攻，结果不出一个月，丹麦人就投降了。</p>
<p>The episode could reasonably serve as a unique epic of royal espionage!</p>
<p>这一幕历史可以说是王室谍报活动中最精彩的篇章。</p>
