<p>Lesson 5 Youth 青年</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>People are always talking about 'the problem of youth'.</p>
<p>人们总是在谈论&ldquo;青年问题&rdquo;。</p>
<p>If there is one -- which I take leave to doubt -- then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves.</p>
<p>如果这个问题存在的话 -- 请允许我对此持怀疑态度 -- 那么，这个问题是由老年人而不是青年人造成的。</p>
<p>Let us get down to fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings -- people just like their elders.</p>
<p>让我们来认真研究一些基本事实：承认青年人和他们的长辈一样也是人。</p>
<p>There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him: and maybe that is where the rub is.</p>
<p>老年人和青年人只有一个区别：青年人有光辉灿烂的前景，而老年人的辉煌已成为过去。问题的症结恐怕就在这里。</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain -- that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem.</p>
<p>我十几岁时，总感到自己年轻，有些事拿不准 -- 我是一所大学里的一名新生，如果我当时真的被看成像一个问题那样有趣，我会感到很得意的。</p>
<p>For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking.</p>
<p>因为这至少使我得到了某种承认，这正是年轻人所热衷追求的。</p>
<p>I find young people exciting.</p>
<p>我觉得年轻人令人振奋，</p>
<p>They have an air of freedom, and they have not a dreary commitment to mean ambitions or love of comfort.</p>
<p>他们无拘无束。既不追逐卑鄙的名利，也不贪图生活的舒适。</p>
<p>They are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to material things.</p>
<p>他们不热衷于向上爬，也不一味追求物质享受。</p>
<p>All this seems to me to link them with life and the origins of things.</p>
<p>在我看来，所有这些使他们与生命和万物之源联系在了一起。</p>
<p>It's as if they were in some sense cosmic beings in violent and lovely contrast with us suburban creatures.</p>
<p>从某种意义上讲，他们似乎是宇宙人，同我们这些凡夫俗子形成了强烈而鲜明的对照。</p>
<p>All that is in my mind when I meet a young person.</p>
<p>每逢我遇到年轻人，脑子里就想到</p>
<p>He may be conceited, ill-mannered, presumptuous or fatuous, but I do not turn for protection to dreary cliches about respect for elders -- as if mere age were a reason for respect.</p>
<p>这些年轻人也许狂妄自负，举止无理，傲慢放肆，愚昧无知，但我不会用应当尊重长者这一套陈词滥调来为我自己辨护，似乎年长就是受人尊敬的理由。</p>
<p>I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.</p>
<p>我认为我和他们是平等的。如果我认为他们错了，我就以平等的身份和他们争个明白。</p>
