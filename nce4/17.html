<p>Lesson 17 A man-made disease 人为的疾病</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>In the early days of the settlement of Australia, enterprising settlers unwisely introduced the European rabbit.</p>
<p>在澳大利亚移民初期，一些有创业精神的移民不明智地把欧洲兔子引进了澳大利亚。</p>
<p>This rabbit had no natural enemies in the Antipodes, so that it multiplied with that promiscuous abandon characteristic of rabbits.</p>
<p>这种兔子在澳大利亚及新西兰没有天敌，因此便以兔子所特有的杂乱交配迅猛繁殖起来。</p>
<p>It overran a whole continent.</p>
<p>整个澳洲兔子成灾。</p>
<p>It caused devastation by burrowing and by devouring the herbage which might have maintained millions of sheep and cattle.</p>
<p>它们在地下打洞，吃掉本可以饲养数百万头牛羊的牧草，给澳洲大陆造成了毁灭性的破坏。</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that this particular variety of rabbit (and apparently no other animal) was susceptible to a fatal virus disease, myxomatosis.</p>
<p>科学家们发现，这种特殊品种的兔子（显然不包括别的动物）易患一种叫&ldquo;多发性粘液瘤&rdquo;的致命毒性疾病。</p>
<p>By infecting animals and letting them loose in the burrows, local epidemics of this disease could be created.</p>
<p>通过让染上此病的动物在洞内乱跑，就可以使这种疾病在一个地区蔓延起来。</p>
<p>Later it was found that there was a type of mosquito which acted as the carrier of this disease and passed it on to the rabbits.</p>
<p>后来又发现，有一种蚊子是传播这种疾病的媒介，能把此病传染给兔子。</p>
<p>So while the rest of the world was trying to get rid of mosquitoes, Australia was encouraging this one.</p>
<p>因此，世界上其他地方在设法消灭蚊子的时候，澳大利亚却在促使这种蚊子大量繁殖。</p>
<p>It effectively spread the disease all over the continent and drastically reduced the rabbit population.</p>
<p>蚊子把这种疾病扩散到整个澳洲大陆，效果甚佳，结果兔子的数目在为减少。</p>
<p>It later became apparent that rabbits were developing a degree of resistance to this disease, so that the rabbit population was unlikely to be completely exterminated.</p>
<p>后来，明显看出，兔子对这种疾病已产生了一定程度的免疫力，所以兔子不可能被完全消灭。</p>
<p>There were hopes, however, that the problem of the rabbit would become manageable.</p>
<p>但是，已有希望解决兔子所带来的问题。</p>
<p>Ironically, Europe, which had bequeathed the rabbit as a pest to Australia, acquired this man-made disease as a pestilence.</p>
<p>具有讽刺意味的是，欧洲把这种兔子作为有害动物传给澳洲，而欧洲自己却染上了这种人为的瘟疫般的疾病。</p>
<p>A French physician decided to get rid of the wild rabbits on his own estate and introduced myxomatosis.</p>
<p>一位法国内科医生决定除掉自己庄园内的野兔子，于是引进了这种多发性粘液瘤疾病。</p>
<p>It did not, however, remain within the confines of this estate.</p>
<p>然而，这种疾病并未被局限在他的庄园内，</p>
<p>It spread through France, where wild rabbits are not generally regarded as a pest but as a sport and a useful food supply, and it spread to Britain where wild rabbits are regarded as a pest but where domesticated rabbits, equally susceptible to the disease, are the basis of a profitable fur industry.</p>
<p>结果在整个法国蔓延开来。野兔在法国一般不被当作有害动物，而被视为打猎取乐的玩物和有用的食物来源。这种疾病又蔓延到了英国。在英国，野兔被当作有害的动物，可是家兔是赚钱的毛皮工业的基础，然而家兔同样易感染这种疾病。</p>
<p>The question became one of whether Man could control the disease he had invented.</p>
<p>现在的问题是，人类能否控制住这种人为的疾病。</p>
