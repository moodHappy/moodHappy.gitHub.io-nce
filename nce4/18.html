<p>Lesson 18 Porpoises 海豚</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>There has long been a superstition among mariners that porpoises will save drowning men by pushing them to the surface, or protect them from sharks by surrounding them in defensive formation.</p>
<p>长期以来，海员中流传着一种迷信的说法，认为海豚会把快要淹死的人托到水面，救人性命；或在人们周围列队保护，使他们免遭鲨鱼伤害。</p>
<p>Marine Studio biologists have pointed out that, however intelligent they may be, it is probably a mistake to credit dolphins with any motive of life-saving.</p>
<p>海洋摄影室的生物学家指出，无论海豚多么聪明，认为它们有救人的动机可能是错误的。</p>
<p>On the occasions when they have pushed to shore an unconscious human being they have much more likely done it out of curiosity or for sport, as in riding the bow waves of a ship.</p>
<p>当它们偶尔把一个失去知觉的人推到岸边时，更大的可能是出于好奇或游戏，就像它们追逐被船首犁开的浪花一样。</p>
<p>In 1928 some porpoises were photographed working like beavers to push ashore a waterlogged mattress.</p>
<p>1928年，有人拍摄到了海豚像海狸一样把浸透水的床垫推上岸的情景。</p>
<p>If, as has been reported, they have protected humans from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks.</p>
<p>正如报道中所说，如果海豚保护人不受鲨鱼侵害，那么它们可能是出于好奇；而鲨鱼可能是闻到了可以美食一顿的香味。</p>
<p>Porpoises and sharks are natural enemies.</p>
<p>海豚和鲨鱼是天然仇敌，</p>
<p>It is possible that upon such an occasion a battle ensued, with the sharks being driven away or killed.</p>
<p>双方可能随之发生搏斗，搏斗结果是海豚赶走或咬死鲨鱼。</p>
<p>Whether it be bird, fish or beast, the porpoise is intrigued with anything that is alive.</p>
<p>海豚对凡是活的东西都感兴趣，不管是鸟、是鱼，还是野兽。</p>
<p>They are constantly after the turtles, who peacefully submit to all sorts of indignities.</p>
<p>它们经常追逐海龟，海龟则温顺地忍受着各种侮辱。</p>
<p>One young calf especially enjoyed raising a turtle to the surface with his snout, and then shoving him across the tank like an aquaplane.</p>
<p>一只小海豚特别喜欢用鼻子把海龟推到水面，然后像滑水板一样把海龟从水池的这一边推到那一边。</p>
<p>Almost any day a young porpoises may be seen trying to turn a 300-pound sea turtle over by sticking his snout under the edge of his shell and pushing up for dear life.</p>
<p>几乎每天都可以看到一只小海豚把鼻子顶入一只300磅重的海龟的硬壳下面，拼命地把它翻过来。</p>
<p>This is not easy, and may require two porpoises working together.</p>
<p>这并非易事，可能需要两只海豚合伙干才行。</p>
<p>In another game, as the turtle swims across the oceanarium, the first porpoise swoops down from above and butts his shell with his belly.</p>
<p>在另一场游戏中，当海龟游过水族馆时，第一只海豚从上方猛扑下去，用腹部撞击龟壳。</p>
<p>This knocks the turtle down several feet.</p>
<p>这一下子把海龟撞下去好几英尺。</p>
<p>He no sooner recovers his equilibrium than the next porpoise comes along and hits him another crack.</p>
<p>海龟刚恢复平衡，第二只海豚又冲过来猛击一下。</p>
<p>Eventually the turtle has been butted all the way down to the floor of the tank.</p>
<p>这只海龟最终被撞到池底。</p>
<p>He is now satisfied merely to try to stand up, but as soon as he does so a porpoise knocks him flat.</p>
<p>此时的海龟，只要能站起来就满足了，但它刚站起来，就被一只海豚击倒。</p>
<p>The turtle at last gives up by pulling his feet under his shell and the game is over.</p>
<p>海龟终于屈服了，将4条腿缩进壳内。游戏到此结束。</p>

<p>知识点（1）Lesson03-33 非限定定语从句 定语从句知识点（4-1）</p>
<p>语法：as引导的非限定定语从句修饰整个句子</p>
<p>课文举例：</p>
<p>Things can go wrong on a big scale, as （关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做discovered的宾语） a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney.</p>
<p>As （关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做explained的宾语） the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!</p>
<p>If, as（关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做主语） has been reported, they have protected humans from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks.</p>
<p>As（关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做主语） is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil.</p>
<p>【辨析】</p>
<p>语法：as 引导的非限定性定语从句与 which 引导的非限定性定语从句的区别。</p>
<p>1、as 作为关系代词指代整个主句，而 which 作为关系代词指代整个主句或先行词均可。</p>
<p>2、as 引导的非限定性定语从句位于主句前、中、后均可，而which 引导的非限定性定语从句不能位于主句之前。</p>
<p>As a poet points out, life is but a dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children, as is always the case, love their mother.</p>
<p>She became angry, as many could see.</p>
<p>3、as 引导的非限定性定语从句含有&ldquo;众所周知&rdquo;的意思，常译为&ldquo;正如&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;，而which 引导的非限定性定语从句则未必有这个意思。</p>
<p>The sun heats the earth, which makes it possible for plants to grow.（不能换成as，没有&ldquo;正如&rdquo;的含义）</p>
