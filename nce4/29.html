<p>Lesson 29 The hovercraft 气垫船</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>Many strange new means of transport have been developed in our century, the strangest of them being perhaps the hovercraft.</p>
<p>本世纪已研制出许多新奇的交通工具，其中最新奇的要数气垫船了。</p>
<p>In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his fifties, Christopher Cockerell, who had turned to boat-building on the Norfolk Broads, suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British Government and industrial circles.</p>
<p>1953年，有一位50多岁名叫克里斯托弗.科克雷的原电子工程师，改行在诺福克郡的湖泊地区从事造船业，他向英国政府和工业界提出了他研究多年的一项计划。</p>
<p>It was the idea of supporting a craft on a 'pad', or cushion, of low-pressure air, ringed with a curtain of higher pressure air.</p>
<p>他的设想是：用一个低压空气或软垫来支撑船体，软垫周围用高压空气环绕。</p>
<p>Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes, or land vehicles -- for it is something in between a boat and an aircraft.</p>
<p>自那以后，人们很难决定是否应该将这种运载工具列为轮船、飞机，或是陆上交通工具，因为它是介于船和飞机之间。</p>
<p>As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance which wastes a good deal of a surface ship's power and limits its speed.</p>
<p>作为一个船舶技师，科克雷尔在寻找解决波浪阻力的方法，因为波浪阻力浪费掉了船在水面行驶的大量动力，从而限制了船的速度。</p>
<p>His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by making it ride on a cushion of air, no more than one or two feet thick.</p>
<p>他的解决办法是把船体提离水面，让船在一个气垫上行驶，气垫只有一两英尺厚。</p>
<p>This is done by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>船底装上大量环状喷气嘴以实现这一目的。</p>
<p>It 'flies', therefore, but it cannot fly higher -- its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>这样船就能飞了，但飞不高。它的飞行限决于它所悬浮的水面或地面。</p>
<p>The first tests on the Solent in 1959 caused a sensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1959年，在苏伦特海峡进行的首次试航引起了轰动。</p>
<p>The hovercraft travelled first over the water, then mounted the beach, climbed up the dunes, and sat down on a road.</p>
<p>气垫船先是在水面上行驶，后又登上海岸，爬上沙丘，最后停在路上。</p>
<p>Later it crossed the Channel, riding smoothly over the waves, which presented no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>后来气垫船跨越英吉利海峡，平衡地在波浪上方行驶，波浪不再产生阻力。</p>
<p>Since that time, various types of hovercraft have appeared and taken up regular service.</p>
<p>从那以后，各种各样的气垫船出现了，并开始了定期航行服务。</p>
<p>The hovercraft is particularly useful in large areas with poor communications such as Africa or Australia; it can become a 'flying fruit-bowl', carrying bananas from the plantations to the ports; giant hovercraft liners could span the Atlantic; and the railway of the future may well be the 'hovertrain', riding on its air cushion over a single rail, which it never touches, at speeds, up to 300 m. p. h. -- the possibilities appear unlimited.</p>
<p>气垫船在非洲、澳大利亚等交通不发达地区特别有用；它能成为&ldquo;飞行水果盘子&rdquo;，把香蕉从种植园动到港口；大型的气垫班轮或许能跨越大西洋；未来的火车或许能成为&ldquo;气垫火车&rdquo;，靠气垫在单轨上行驶而不接触轨道，时速可达每小时300英里。</p>
