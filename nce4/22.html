<p>Lesson 22 Knowledge and progress 知识和进步</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>Why does the idea of progress loom so large in the modern world?</p>
<p>为什么进步这个概念在现代世界显得如此突出？</p>
<p>Surely because progress of a particular kind is actually taking place around us and is becoming more and more manifest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>无疑是因为有一种特殊的进步实际上正在我们周围发生，而且变得越来越明显。</p>
<p>Although mankind has undergone no general improvement in intelligence or morality, it has made extraordinary progress in the accumulation of knowledge.</p>
<p>虽然人类有智力和道德上没有得到普遍提高，但在知识积累方面却取得了巨大的进步。</p>
<p>Knowledge began to increase as soon as the thoughts of one individual could be communicated to another by means of speech.</p>
<p>人一旦能用语言同别人交流思想，知识的积累便开始了。</p>
<p>With the invention of writing, a great advance was made, for knowledge could then be not only communicated but also stored.</p>
<p>随着书写的发明，又迈进了一大步，因为这样一来，知识不仅能交流，而且能储存了。</p>
<p>Libraries made education possible, and education in its turn added to libraries: the growth of knowledge followed a kind of compound interest law, which was greatly enhanced by the invention of printing.</p>
<p>藏书使教育成为可能，而教育反过来又丰富了藏书，因为知识的增长遵循着一种&ldquo;滚雪球&rdquo;的规律，印刷术的发明又大大提高了知识增长的速度。</p>
<p>All this was comparatively slow until, with the coming of science, the tempo was suddenly raised.</p>
<p>所有这些发展都比较缓慢，而随着科学的到来，增长的速度才突然加快。</p>
<p>Then knowledge began to be accumulated according to a systematic plan.</p>
<p>于是，知识便开始有系统有计划地积累起来。</p>
<p>The trickle became a stream: the stream has now become a torrent.</p>
<p>涓涓细流汇成小溪，小溪现已变成了奔腾的江河。</p>
<p>Moreover, as soon as new knowledge is acquired, it is now turned to practical account.</p>
<p>而且，新知识一旦获得，便得到实际应用。</p>
<p>What is called 'modern civilization' is not the result of a balanced development of all man's nature, but of accumulated knowledge applied to practical life.</p>
<p>所谓&ldquo;现代文明&rdquo;并不是人的天性平衡发展的结果，而是积累起来的知识应用到实际生活中的结果。</p>
<p>The problem now facing humanity is: What is going to be done with all this knowledge?</p>
<p>现在人类面临的问题是：用这些知识去做什么？</p>
<p>As is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil.</p>
<p>正像人们常常指出的，知识是一把双刃刀，可以用于造福，也可以用来为害。</p>
<p>It is now being used indifferently for both.</p>
<p>人们现在正漫不经心地把知识用于这两个方面，</p>
<p>Could any spectacle, for instance, be more grimly whimsical than that of gunners using science to shatter men's bodies while, close at hand, surgeons use it to restore them?</p>
<p>例如：炮兵利用科学毁坏人的身体、而外科医生就在附近用科学抢救被炮兵毁坏的人体，还有什么情景比这更可怕、更怪诞的吗？</p>
<p>We have to ask ourselves very seriously what will happen if this twofold use of knowledge, with its ever-increasing power, continues.</p>
<p>我们不得不严肃地问问我们自己：随着日益增长的知识的力量，如果我们继续利用知识的这种双重性，将会发生什么样的情况呢？</p>
