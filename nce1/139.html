<p><code> </code><strong>1.   —Is that you，John？ 是你吗，约翰？</strong></p>
<p><code>       </code><strong>—Yes，speaking。是我，请讲</strong>。</p>
<p>口语化的电话用语。正式用语：Is that John speaking？或 Excuse me，I&#39;d like to speak to John.</p>
<p>注意，在英文中，打电话开始时说“你是......？”“我是......？”时，不用 Are you ...？ 或 I am ...，而用that或this来代替。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>2．Tell Mary we&#39;ll be late for dinner this evening. 你告诉玛丽，今晚吃饭我们将晚到一会儿。</strong></p>
<p>句中 we will be late…是一个宾语从句，作动词 tell 的宾语，Mary 是间接宾语。</p>
<p>这个宾语从句省略了引导词that。late表示“迟到”的意思时通常作表语，与for连用。 be late for... 做......迟到</p>
<p>Hurry up, or we&#39;ll be late for the movie. 
<code>     </code>快点儿！不然看电影就晚了。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>3.  She invited Charlotte and me to dinner this evening.  她邀请我和夏洛特今晚去吃饭。</strong></p>
<p>一般过去时陈述句，this evening 作时间状语。</p>
<p>invite sb. to dinner 请某人吃饭   </p>
<p>【联想记忆】invite sb. to one&#39;s house 请某人到家中作客     </p>
<p>invite sb. to one&#39;s country  邀请某人到自己的国家访问</p>
<p>invite sb. to do sth.  邀请某人做某事</p>

<p><code> </code>**4．by the way, 顺便（问、说一下）。**说话者忽然想到另一件事的时候用此来表示改变话题。</p>

<p><code> </code><strong>语法 Grammar in use</strong></p>
<p><code> </code><strong>宾语从句（2</strong>）</p>
<p><code> </code>在以前已介绍过宾语从句一般由that, which和whom引导，它们有时在口语中可以省略。除此之外，宾语从句还可以由when, where, what, why, how以及 if和 whether这些疑问词来引导，而它们在句中往往不能加以省略。无论是that, if还是wh-疑问词引导的宾语从句通常都应以陈述句的形式出现。</p>
