<p>新概念第一册129-130 课文详解及练习答案</p>
<p><strong>课文详注 Further notes on the text</strong></p>
<p><code> </code><strong>1．Where do you think you are?你认为你现在是在哪儿？</strong></p>
<p>do you think 是用在非凡疑问句中的插入语，用来征询见解或表达看法。因为句中插入语已经是疑问式，主谓倒装了，所以you are的位置不能再对调了。插入语一般是对句子加一些附加的解释，在句子中作独立成分。常用来作插入语的结构有I hope, I think, I&#39;m afraid, you know等。插入语可以位于句尾或句中，有时也可出现在疑问句中。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>2．must have been doing sth.,一定/准是在做某事。</strong></p>
<p>这种结构用来表示对过去正进行的事情的推测。下文中的can&#39;t have been是 can&#39;t have been driving的省略式，在意思上与must have been driving正相反。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>3．That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t see the sign.所以我才没看见那牌子。</strong></p>
<p>why I didn&#39;t see the sign作is的表语从句，以why引导的从句用来解释事情的原因。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>4．…you&#39;d better take my advice!……你最好还是服从我的劝告吧！</strong></p>
<p>take one&#39;s advice是“服从劝告”的意思。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>语法 Grammar in use</strong> </p>
<p><code> </code><strong>表示猜测和推断的情态助动词must和can&#39;t（2）</strong></p>
<p><code> </code>must与can&#39;t不仅能表达对现在和将来的猜测和推断，而且能表达对过去的猜测和推断——这时可用 must have been表示肯定的推断，用can&#39;t have been（而不是mustn&#39;t have been）来表示否定的推断，如后面跟进行时则表示对过去正在进行的动作的猜测。请看例句：</p>
<p><code> </code>You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.</p>
<p>你当时肯定正以每小时70英里的速度行驶。</p>
<p><code> </code>I didn&#39;t see it. I must have been dreaming.</p>
<p>我没看见。我当时一定是在胡思乱想吧。</p>
<p><code> </code>She can&#39;t have been 29.She must have been 36.</p>
