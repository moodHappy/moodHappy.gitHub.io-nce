<p>Lesson 129 Seventy miles an hour时速70英里</p>
<p>【课文详注 Further notes on the text】</p>
<p>1．Where do you think you are?你认为你现在是在哪儿？</p>
<p>do you think 是用在非凡疑问句中的插入语，用来征询见解或表达看法。因为句中插入语已经是疑问式，主谓倒装了，所以you are的位置不能再对调了。插入语一般是对句子加一些附加的解释，在句子中作独立成分。常用来作插入语的结构有I hope, I think, I'm afraid, you know等。插入语可以位于句尾或句中，有时也可出现在疑问句中。</p>
<p>2．must have been doing sth.,一定/准是在做某事。</p>
<p>这种结构用来表示对过去正进行的事情的推测。下文中的can't have been是 can't have been driving的省略式，在意思上与must have been driving正相反。</p>
<p>3．That's why I didn't see the sign.所以我才没看见那牌子。</p>
<p>why I didn't see the sign作is的表语从句，以why引导的从句用来解释事情的原因。</p>
<p>4．&hellip;you'd better take my advice!&hellip;&hellip;你最好还是服从我的劝告吧！</p>
<p>take one's advice是&ldquo;服从劝告&rdquo;的意思。</p>
<p>【语法 Grammar in use】&nbsp;</p>
<p>表示猜测和推断的情态助动词must和can't（2）</p>
<p>must与can't不仅能表达对现在和将来的猜测和推断，而且能表达对过去的猜测和推断&mdash;&mdash;这时可用 must have been表示肯定的推断，用can't have been（而不是mustn't have been）来表示否定的推断，如后面跟进行时则表示对过去正在进行的动作的猜测。请看例句：</p>
<p>You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.</p>
<p>你当时肯定正以每小时70英里的速度行驶。</p>
<p>I didn't see it. I must have been dreaming.</p>
<p>我没看见。我当时一定是在胡思乱想吧。</p>
<p>She can't have been 29.She must have been 36.</p>
<p>她那时肯定不会是29岁，她一定36岁了。</p>
<p>He can't have been reading. He must have been sleeping.</p>
<p>他那时肯定不是在看书，他准是在睡觉。</p>

    <h3>1. Must have been：</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Must have been" 用于表达对过去某一时间点或时间段内发生的事情的高度可能性或确定性的推断。</li>
        <li>这种推断通常是基于现有的证据、迹象或逻辑推理。</li>
        <li>例如，在第一个例句中，"You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour."（你当时肯定正以每小时70英里的速度行驶。），说话人可能根据某些线索（如车速表的读数、目击者的证词等）推断出对方当时驾驶的速度。</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>2. Can't have been：</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Can't have been" 用于表达对过去某一时间点或时间段内发生的事情的不可能性的推断。</li>
        <li>这种推断同样基于现有的证据、迹象或逻辑推理，但得出的结论是某件事不太可能或根本不可能发生。</li>
        <li>例如，在第三个例句中，"She can't have been 29. She must have been 36."（她那时肯定不会是29岁，她一定36岁了。），说话人可能根据对方的外貌、已知的出生年份或其他相关信息来推断出对方的实际年龄。</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>3. 对过去进行时的猜测：</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>当我们想要猜测过去某个特定时间点或时间段内正在进行的动作时，我们可以使用 "must have been" 和 "can't have been" 后面跟进行时态。</li>
        <li>例如，在第二个例句中，"I didn't see it. I must have been dreaming."（我没看见。我当时一定是在胡思乱想吧。）这里，说话人可能因为错过了某个事件或现象，推断出自己当时可能在做梦或心不在焉。</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>4. 对过去的完成时的推断：</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>同样地，当我们想要推断过去某个动作是否已经完成时，我们可以使用 "must have" 和 "can't have" 后面跟过去分词。</li>
        <li>例如，在第四个例句中，"He can't have been reading. He must have been sleeping."（他那时肯定不是在看书，他准是在睡觉。）这里，说话人可能根据一系列迹象或行为推断出对方当时并没有阅读，而是在睡觉。</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <p>在使用 "must have been" 和 "can't have been" 进行过去事件的推断时，我们应该意识到这些推断并不是绝对的事实，而是基于当前最佳可用信息做出的合理假设。随着新信息的出现，这些推断可能会被证实或被修正。</p>
