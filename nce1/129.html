<p>Lesson 129 Seventy miles an hour时速70英里</p>
<p>【课文详注 Further notes on the text】</p>
<p>1．Where do you think you are?你认为你现在是在哪儿？</p>
<p>do you think 是用在非凡疑问句中的插入语，用来征询见解或表达看法。因为句中插入语已经是疑问式，主谓倒装了，所以you are的位置不能再对调了。插入语一般是对句子加一些附加的解释，在句子中作独立成分。常用来作插入语的结构有I hope, I think, I'm afraid, you know等。插入语可以位于句尾或句中，有时也可出现在疑问句中。</p>
<p>2．must have been doing sth.,一定/准是在做某事。</p>
<p>这种结构用来表示对过去正进行的事情的推测。下文中的can't have been是 can't have been driving的省略式，在意思上与must have been driving正相反。</p>
<p>3．That's why I didn't see the sign.所以我才没看见那牌子。</p>
<p>why I didn't see the sign作is的表语从句，以why引导的从句用来解释事情的原因。</p>
<p>4．&hellip;you'd better take my advice!&hellip;&hellip;你最好还是服从我的劝告吧！</p>
<p>take one's advice是&ldquo;服从劝告&rdquo;的意思。</p>

<p>表示猜测和推断的情态助动词must和can't（2）</p>
<p>must与can't不仅能表达对现在和将来的猜测和推断，而且能表达对过去的猜测和推断&mdash;&mdash;这时可用 must have been表示肯定的推断，用can't have been（而不是mustn't have been）来表示否定的推断，如后面跟进行时则表示对过去正在进行的动作的猜测。请看例句：</p>
<p>You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.</p>
<p>你当时肯定正以每小时70英里的速度行驶。</p>
<p>I didn't see it. I must have been dreaming.</p>
<p>我没看见。我当时一定是在胡思乱想吧。</p>
<p>She can't have been 29.She must have been 36.</p>
<p>她那时肯定不会是29岁，她一定36岁了。</p>
<p>He can't have been reading. He must have been sleeping.</p>
<p>他那时肯定不是在看书，他准是在睡觉。</p>

<div>
    <p>情态助动词must和can't在英语中用于表达猜测和推断，它们不仅适用于现在和将来的情况，也可以用于对过去事件的推测。在谈论过去时，我们使用"must have been"来表示对某个动作或状态的肯定推断，而使用"can't have been"来表示否定推断。特别地，当我们讨论过去正在进行的动作时，可以在"have been"后面加上进行时态来表达猜测。</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>1. 使用"must have been"进行肯定的过去推断：</p>
    <p>例句："You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour." 这句话表示说话者确信对方在过去某个时刻一定以每小时70英里的速度行驶。这种推断可能是基于一些迹象、证据或是逻辑推理得出的。</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>2. 使用"can't have been"进行否定的过去推断：</p>
    <p>例句："She can't have been 29. She must have been 36." 这里说话者推断她在过去不可能是29岁，而一定是36岁。这种推断可能是根据已知信息或逻辑分析得出的结论。</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>3. 对过去正在进行的动作的猜测：</p>
    <p>例句："I didn't see it. I must have been dreaming." 在这个例子中，说话者表示他没有看到某件事情，因为他可能当时正在做梦。这里的"must have been dreaming"是对过去某一时刻正在进行的动作（做梦）的猜测。</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>4. 结合上下文进行推断：</p>
    <p>例句："He can't have been reading. He must have been sleeping." 这句话表明说话者推断某人在过去不是在阅读，而是在睡觉。这种推断可能是基于观察到的行为、环境或其他相关线索。</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>通过这些例句，我们可以看到must和can't在表达对过去事件的猜测和推断时是非常有用的。它们帮助我们构建了一种逻辑上的联系，使得我们能够根据现有的信息或线索来推测过去可能发生的事情。在使用这些表达时，重要的是要注意语气和上下文，以确保推断的合理性和准确性。</p>
