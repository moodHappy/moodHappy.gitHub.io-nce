新概念第一册135-136 课文详解及练习答案

**课文详注 Further notes on the text** 

` `**1．He won't let me make another film.他不会再让我拍电影了。** 

句中动词let后面的不定式不带to，类似的例子如动词have，make等。  句型为：let/have/make sb. do sth.

` `**2．introduce A to B,  将A介绍给B，向B介绍A。**

The speaker introduced himself to the audience. 演讲的人把自己介绍给听众。

` `**3．get married, 结婚。**

get married （结婚），表示结婚的行为，属终止性动作；be married （已结婚），表示已婚的状态，可以表示时间的延续；

marry  vt. 表示“嫁”、“娶”、“结婚”、“与......结婚”的意思。根据要求不同，有时接宾语，有时则不接；还可以构成 marry sb. to...（把......嫁给......）。例如：

At last she married that young man. 最后，他与那个年轻人结婚了。

The old couple married well. 这对老夫妇婚姻美满。

She wanted to marry her daughter to a rich man. 他想把她的女儿嫁给一个有钱人。

` `**4．the latest = the latest news 最新消息。**

` `**5．…she would have to ask her future husband．……她得问问她的未婚夫。**

` `这部分是从句，在整句话中作said的直接宾语。 would have to ask是过去将来时结构。因为主句的谓语动词是said，相对过去的这一时间点的将来就是过去的将来，所以用过去将来时结构。

` `**语法 Grammar in use**

` `**1．let的用法**

` `let与一般动词不同，它用于动词+宾语+动词原形结构，即let后面可接名词或代词，再接不带to的动词不定式。其意思为“答应”、“让”。请看例句：

` `She lets her son play in the garden.

` `她让她的儿子在花园里玩。

` `Her parents wouldn't let her go out with that boy.

` `她的父母不答应她与那个男孩子一起出去。

` `They didn't let the guests smoke in the lobby.

` `他们不答应客人们在大厅吸烟。

` `**2．间接引语中情态助动词由现在时如何变为过去时**（参见 Lessons 133～134语法部分。）
