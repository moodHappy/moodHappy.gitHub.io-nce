<p>新概念第一册143-144 课文详解及练习答案</p>
<p>课<strong>文详注 Further notes on the text</strong> </p>
<p><code> </code><strong>1．I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods. 我住在一个由美丽的树林环绕的古老的小镇上。</strong></p>
<p>这是一个主从复合句，which is surrounded by ... 为定语从句，修饰town。which 指代 town 。从句用的是被动语态，“被......所包围”，如果将从句独立为一个句子，则为：My town is  surrounded by beautiful woods.</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>2.  on Sundays 是泛指“在星期天”，而不是指在某个星期天。</strong></p>
<p><code> </code><strong>3．hundreds of people，数以百计的（游）人。</strong></p>
<p>hundreds of people 复数形式表概数，“数以......计的”与 of 连用，作名词的修饰语，其后面的名词必然是复数形式。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>4.  . . . to see our town and to walk through the woods. 来参观我们的小镇并在树林中散步。</strong></p>
<p>to  see our town and to walk through the woods 为不定式短语作目的状语。</p>
<p>这里用 and 连接的两个动词不定式。介词through，“穿过”，强调纵深向，如：walk through the forest  穿过森林：而 across 强调横向，如：</p>
<p>walk across the street  横穿街道</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>5．Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy．游客已被告知要保持树林的整洁。</strong></p>
<p>现在完成时的被动语态，说明需求的行为应为游客所知。（句中 have been asked是被动语态的完成时结构。详见本课语法部分。）to keep the woods clean and tidy 是动词不定式短语，作主语visitors的补足语。clean and tidy 是宾语 the woods 的宾语补足语。</p>
<p>clean and tidy 表示“整洁的，清洁的”这是英语中的常用结构，其它常见的类似结构还有：<br>black and blue 青一块紫一块；<br>happy and gay 高高兴兴</p>
heart and soul 全心全意，一心一意</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>6．go for a walk，去散步</strong>。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>7．What I saw made me very sad．我所见到的一切使我非常难过</strong>。</p>
<p>句中的主语 What I saw 是 what 引导的名词性从句（主语从句）。例如：</p>
<p>What the little boy did surprised his mother. 那个小男孩所做的一切使他母亲十分惊讶。</p>
<p>What you do makes me happy. 你所做的是我愉快。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>8.  The litter baskets were empty and ground was covered with pieces of paper，cigarette ends，old tyres，empty bottles and rusty tins.</strong></p>
<p>句中 and 连接的并列句，“the litter baskets were empty” 与“groun was ... 分别为两个并列分句，be covered with ... 被 ...... 覆盖。如：</p>
<p>The desks are covered with dust. 桌子上布满了灰尘。</p>
<p>The ground was covered with snow. 地上覆盖着雪。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>9.  Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted！凡在此树林里丢垃圾者，将依法处置。</strong></p>
<p>这是一个主从复合句，who 引导定语从句，修饰先行词anyone 。will be prosecuted 为将来时的被动语态。</p>
<p>Anyone who comes to the party is welcome. 该晚会来者不拒。</p>
<p>Anyone who breaks the traffic regulations will be fined. 任何违反交通规则的人都会被罚款。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>语法 Grammar in use</strong></p>
<p><code> </code><strong>被动语态（2）</strong></p>
<p><code> </code>上一次介绍了被动语态的一般现在时和一般过去时形式，这里介绍其现在完成时和一般将来时形式：</p>
<p><code> </code>（1）现在完成时形式： has/have + been + 过去分词：</p>
<p>The basket has already been emptied.  篮子已经被腾空了。</p>
<p><code>  </code>They have already been invited.  他们已被邀请。</p>
<p><code> </code>（2）一般将来时形式： will/shall +be +过去分词：</p>
