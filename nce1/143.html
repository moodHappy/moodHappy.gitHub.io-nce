<p>Lesson 143 A walk through the woods林中散步</p>
<p>课文详注 Further notes on the text&nbsp;</p>
<p>1．Ilive in a very old town whichis surrounded by beautiful woods. 我住在一个由美丽的树林环绕的古老的小镇上。</p>
<p>这是一个主从复合句，which is surrounded by ... 为定语从句，修饰town。which 指代 town 。从句用的是被动语态，&ldquo;被......所包围&rdquo;，如果将从句独立为一个句子，则为：My town issurrounded by beautiful woods.</p>
<p>2. on Sundays 是泛指&ldquo;在星期天&rdquo;，而不是指在某个星期天。</p>
<p>3．hundreds of people，数以百计的（游）人。</p>
<p>hundreds of people 复数形式表概数，&ldquo;数以......计的&rdquo;与 of 连用，作名词的修饰语，其后面的名词必然是复数形式。</p>
<p>4. . . . to see our town and to walk through the woods. 来参观我们的小镇并在树林中散步。</p>
<p>tosee our town and to walk through the woods 为不定式短语作目的状语。</p>
<p>这里用 and 连接的两个动词不定式。介词through，&ldquo;穿过&rdquo;，强调纵深向，如：walk through the forest 穿过森林：而 across 强调横向，如：</p>
<p>walk across the street 横穿街道</p>
<p>5．Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy．游客已被告知要保持树林的整洁。</p>
<p>现在完成时的被动语态，说明需求的行为应为游客所知。（句中 have been asked是被动语态的完成时结构。详见本课语法部分。）to keep the woods clean and tidy 是动词不定式短语，作主语visitors的补足语。clean and tidy 是宾语 the woods 的宾语补足语。</p>
<p>clean and tidy 表示&ldquo;整洁的，清洁的&rdquo;这是英语中的常用结构，其它常见的类似结构还有：black and blue 青一块紫一块；happy and gay 高高兴兴</p>
<p>heart and soul 全心全意，一心一意</p>
<p>6．go for a walk，去散步。</p>
<p>7．What I saw made me very sad．我所见到的一切使我非常难过。</p>
<p>句中的主语 What I saw 是 what 引导的名词性从句（主语从句）。例如：</p>
<p>What the little boy did surprised his mother. 那个小男孩所做的一切使他母亲十分惊讶。</p>
<p>What you do makes me happy. 你所做的是我愉快。</p>
<p>8. The litter baskets were empty and ground was covered with pieces of paper，cigarette ends，old tyres，empty bottles andrusty tins.</p>
<p>句中 and 连接的并列句，&ldquo;the litter baskets were empty&rdquo; 与&ldquo;groun was ... 分别为两个并列分句，be covered with ... 被 ...... 覆盖。如：</p>
<p>The desks are covered with dust. 桌子上布满了灰尘。</p>
<p>The ground was covered with snow. 地上覆盖着雪。</p>
<p>9. Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted！凡在此树林里丢垃圾者，将依法处置。</p>
<p>这是一个主从复合句，who 引导定语从句，修饰先行词anyone 。will be prosecuted 为将来时的被动语态。</p>
<p>Anyone who comes to the party is welcome. 该晚会来者不拒。</p>
<p>Anyone who breaks the traffic regulations will be fined.任何违反交通规则的人都会被罚款。</p>
<p>语法 Grammar in use</p>
<p>被动语态（2）</p>
<p>上一次介绍了被动语态的一般现在时和一般过去时形式，这里介绍其现在完成时和一般将来时形式：</p>
<p>（1）现在完成时形式： has/have + been + 过去分词：</p>
<p>The basket has already been emptied. 篮子已经被腾空了。</p>
<p>They have already been invited. 他们已被邀请。</p>
<p>（2）一般将来时形式： will/shall +be +过去分词：</p>
<p>The floor will be swept soon. 地不久就会扫的。</p>
<p>The knives will be sharpened soon. 刀不久就会磨的。</p>
