<p>新概念第一册141-142 课文详解及练习答案</p>
<p><strong>课文详注 Further notes on the text</strong> </p>
<p><code> </code><strong>1．my four-year-old daughter，我那4岁的女儿。</strong></p>
<p>four-year-old 是名词 daughter的定语。各词用连字符连在一起，构成一个复合形容词。注意在这个复合词中仅用单数 year，而不用复数：如：</p>
<p>a thirteen-year-old girl  一个13岁的姑娘     a five-year-old boy 一个五岁的男孩    a three-meter-tall tree 一棵三米高的树</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>2．… Sally was invited to a children&#39;s party. ……萨莉被邀请去参加一个儿童聚会。</strong></p>
<p>这是一个被动语态的例子。在英文中，假如想避免用含混不清的词（如 someone等）作主语，经常可使用被动词态。（具体请参见本课语法部分。）被动语态由相应的be动词加上过去分词构成：</p>
<p>It is repaired regularly. 它定期修理。</p>
<p>They are corrected regularly. 它们得到了定期校正。</p>
<p>He was met at the station this morning. 今早有人在车站接他。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>3．She had never travelled on a train before. 她以前从未坐过火车。</strong></p>
<p>这句话使用的是过去完成时，副词before通常用于完成时态（现在完成时或过去完成时）的句子里，而ago用在过去时的句子里。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>4. a middle-aged lady，一位中年女士。</strong></p>
<p>middle-aged是一个复合形容词，这种复合形容词是由名词/形容词+过去分词构成。例如：</p>
<p>a hand-made coat 一件手工制作的上衣</p>
<p>a large-eyed boy 一个大眼睛的男孩</p>
<p>a long-legged girl 一个长腿的姑娘</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>5．opposite Sally，在萨莉的对面。</strong></p>
<p>这是介词短语，作状语，修饰sat，表示其具体状态、情况。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>6．take out，拿出。</strong></p>
<p><code> </code><strong>7．make up her face，往她的脸上施脂粉。</strong></p>
<p>make up意为“化妆”、“妆扮”（指擦胭脂、抹粉）。</p>
<p><code> </code>8**．To make myself beautiful …    把自己妆扮漂亮……**</p>
<p>这是一个省略句，句首省略了I am doing that，而只留下这个作目的状语的动词不定式短语；beautiful 作 myself 的宾语补足语。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>9．put away，收拾好，储存备用</strong>。</p>
<p>She washed the cups and <strong>put</strong> them <strong>away</strong>.  她洗完杯子后便把他们收了起来。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>语法 Grammar in use</strong></p>
<p><code> </code><strong>被动语态（1）</strong></p>
<p><code> </code>英语动词有主动语态和被动语态之分。在主动句中，动词的主语是执行动作的人或物。在被动句中，主语是动作的承受者。</p>
<p><code> </code>在英语中被动词态用得很普遍，这样做可以避免用不明确的词作主语，或是将说话的重点放在事件而不是造成该事件的人或物上。</p>
<p><code> </code>被动语态的构成： be +过去分词。</p>
<p><code> </code>过去分词不一定指过去。请看例句：</p>
<p><code> </code>（1）一般现在时形式： am/are/is +过去分词：</p>
<p>The room is aired regularly. 这个房间定期通风。</p>
<p>The knives are sharpened regularly. 刀定期磨。</p>
<p><code> </code>（2）一般过去时形式： was/were +过去分词：</p>
<p>She was dressed in red. 她身穿红色衣服。</p>
<p>The windows were opened this morning. 窗户今早是开着的／被打开了。</p>
<p><code> </code>（3）英语中表达感情的动词通常可用于被动式，这些动词如：amuse, embarrass, worry, surprise, interest, upset等：</p>
<p>She is embarrassed. 她感到尴尬。</p>
<p>They were worried. 他们感到担忧。 </p>
