<p>Lesson 119 Atrue story一个真实的故事</p>
<p>课文详注 Further notes on the text</p>
<p>1．... happen to sb. , (某事) 发生在某人的身上.</p>
<p>What happened to you yesterday? 你昨天出什么事了？</p>
<p>2．a friend of mine,我的朋友之一。</p>
<p>相当于one of my friends，但前者比后者显得更为亲切。</p>
<p>3．After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room. 他们进到屋里后，走进了饭厅。</p>
<p>After they had entered the house 是时间状语从句，had entered 是过去完成时结构。在以after引导的时间状语从句中，用一般过去时或过去完成时没有多少差别。假如强调从句的谓语动作在主句的谓语动作之前完成，就用过去完成时。</p>
<p>4．turn on, 打开，拧开（电视、水源、煤气等）。</p>
<p>其反义词为 turn off（关上）。</p>
<p>5. as quickly as they could 是状语，修饰 run away 。</p>
<p>第一个as是副词，修饰quickly，第二个as是连词，引导比较状语从句。could 后省略了run，意思是&ldquo;能跑多快就跑多快&rdquo;。例如：</p>
<p>He worked as hard as he could. 他工作十分努力。（能多努力就多努力）</p>
<p>语法 Grammar in use</p>
<p>过去完成时</p>
<p>构成： had +过去分词。</p>
<p>过去完成时主要用于表示两个事件中一个发生在前，或者说是表示较早的过去。常与现在完成时连用的副词，如 already（已经）， ever（曾经），for +表示时间段的词，just（刚刚）和never（从未）也常与过去完成时连用，以强调事件发生的先后次序。有时我们不一定非得用过去完成时表示先发生的事件，因为意思十分清楚，如：</p>
<p>After I finished ,I went home.</p>
<p>我做完后就回家了。</p>
<p>请看例句：</p>
<p>She went on holiday after she had taken the exam.</p>
<p>她考试后度假去了。</p>
<p>I ran to the platform quickly, but the train had already left.</p>
<p>我赶紧跑到站台上，但是火车已经开走了。</p>
<p>We had had dinner before they arrived.</p>
<p>他们到达之前我们就已吃饭了。</p>
<p>The patient had died when the doctor arrived.</p>
<p>大夫到达时病人已经死了。</p>

    <h3>过去完成时的用法</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>表示较早的过去：</strong>
            <p>过去完成时最常用的情况是强调一个动作在另一个过去的动作之前已经完成。这可以用来表明两个过去事件的先后顺序。</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>He had already eaten breakfast when I arrived.（我到的时候他已经吃过早餐了。）</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>与现在完成时连用的副词：</strong>
            <p>一些常与现在完成时连用的副词，如“already”（已经）、“ever”（曾经）、“for + 表示时间段的词”、“just”（刚刚）和“never”（从未），也可以用来与过去完成时连用，以强调事件发生的先后次序。</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>Had you ever been to Paris before that trip?（你那次旅行之前去过巴黎吗？）</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>无需明确表示先发生的事件：</strong>
            <p>有时候，即使不使用过去完成时，上下文中的时间顺序也是清晰的。然而，使用过去完成时可以更加明确地表达这种顺序。</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>He closed the door after he had locked it.（他锁好门后才关上它。）</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>过去完成时的构成</h3>
    <p>过去完成时的构成是将助动词“had”与动词的过去分词结合。具体如下：</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>肯定句：</strong> 主语 + had + 过去分词</li>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> They had built the house before the war.（他们在战争前建了这座房子。）</p>
        <li><strong>否定句：</strong> 主语 + had not (or hadn't) + 过去分词</li>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The children hadn't finished their homework when I checked.（我检查时，孩子们还没完成作业。）</p>
        <li><strong>疑问句：</strong> Had + 主语 + 过去分词 + 其他？</li>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Had she ever tried skiing before her vacation?（她假期之前尝试过滑雪吗？）</p>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <p>通过熟练掌握过去完成时的用法和构成，我们可以更加准确地描述过去事件的时间顺序和关系。这不仅有助于提高我们的语言表达能力，还能使我们的叙述更加清晰和有逻辑性。</p>
