<p><strong>课文详注 Further notes on the text</strong> </p>
<p><code> </code><strong>1．Have you just made a new film, Miss Marsh? 您刚拍完一部电影吗，马什小姐？</strong></p>
<p>make 可表示“作出某种举动”，其意义根据宾语而定。本句中的make可理解为“拍（摄）”。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>2．make another,再拍一部。</strong> 之后省略了film。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>3．by our reporter = reported/written by our reporter。</strong></p>
<p><code> </code><strong>4.  I wonder why！= I wonder why she is not going to make another film.</strong></p>
<p>（1）wonder = want to know 想知道；（表示疑虑）</p>
<p>（2）wonder 后可以跟 why/what/who/where/when/how 等特殊疑问词引导的宾语从句。</p>
<p><code> </code><strong>语法 Grammar in use</strong></p>
<p><code> </code><strong>需改变时态的间接陈述句</strong></p>
<p><code> </code>间接引语里常要改变时态，这是因为原来讲的话与转述这些话之间有一段间隔。选择哪种恰当的形式取决于转述者的着眼点。在间接引语里通常并不确切地重复讲话者说过的话。转述通常发生在过去，所以引述动词通常是过去时。因此，转述时从句的时态通常要“往回移”（back shift）。一条普遍的规则是：现在时变为过去时，过去时变为过去完成时。为过去时的情态助动词和过去完成时在转述时不变，因为不可能再往回移了。</p>
<p><code> </code>使用间接引语主要是为了简洁、紧凑地把说话内容转述给第3者。请看下面直接引语变成间接引语时在时态等方面必须作出的相应变化：</p>
<p>（1）一般现在时改为一般过去时：</p>

<p><code> </code>I&#39;m having a rest,’ she told them.</p>
<p>She told them (that) she was having a rest.</p>
<p>她告诉他们说她当时正在休息。</p>
<p>（3）现在完成时改成过去完成时：</p>
<p><code> </code>I&#39;ve just made a new film,’ she told me.</p>
<p>She told me(that) she had just made a new film.</p>
<p>她告诉我说她刚完成一部新影片。</p>
<p>（4）一般将来时改成过去将来时（一般用would +动词原形）：</p>
<p><code> </code>I&#39;ll have to ask my husband,’she said.</p>
<p>She said (that) she would have to ask her husband.</p>
<p>她说她将得去问问她丈夫。</p>
<p>（5）情态动词由现在时改成过去时或条件时态：</p>
<p>I can see you tomorrow,’she said.</p>
<p>She said (that) she could see me the next day.</p>
<p>她说她下一天可以见我。</p>
<p>I&#39;ll help you,’she said.</p>
<p>She said (that) she would help me.</p>
<p>她说她将帮助我。</p>
<p>I may return at six o&#39;clock,’ she told me.</p>
<p>She told me (that) she might return at six o&#39;clock.</p>
<p>她告诉我说她可能6点钟回来。</p>
<p>（6）为过去时或条件时态的情态助动词不变：</p>
<p>I could see you tomorrow,’she said.</p>
<p>She said (that) she could see me the next day.</p>
<p>她说她第2天会见我。</p>
<p><code> </code>I would complain if I were you,’she told me.</p>
