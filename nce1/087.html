<p>Lesson 087 A car cras车祸</p>
<p>课文详注&nbsp;Further notes on the text&nbsp;</p>
<p>1．When did you bring it to us? 您什么时候送来的？</p>
<p>bring表示&ldquo;送来&rdquo;、&ldquo;带来&rdquo;和&ldquo;拿来&rdquo;的意思，在方位上多指朝说话人而来。</p>
<p>2．&hellip;they're still working on it. &hellip;&hellip;他们还在修呢。</p>
<p>work on 表示&ldquo;从事&rdquo;、&ldquo;干&rdquo;（某事）。 still是&ldquo;仍然&rdquo;、&ldquo;还在&rdquo;的意思，此处在句中对 working on it起了强调的作用。</p>
<p>3．have a look at it, 看一下。</p>
<p>这里的 it指 car，以避免重复。这里的 look是名词，have a look at与 look at意思是一样的。</p>
<p>4．Isn't that your car? 这难道不是您的车吗？</p>
<p>Didn't you have a crash? 难道您没有出车祸吗？</p>
<p>在英文中可以用一般疑问句的否定形式来表示期待、请求或希望得到肯定的答复。</p>
<p>语法&nbsp;Grammar in use</p>
<p>现在完成时的疑问式及否定式</p>
<p>现在完成时的构成是 have／has+ 过去分词，因此其疑问式是将have／has提到主语之前，否定式则在have／has后加上not即可。</p>
