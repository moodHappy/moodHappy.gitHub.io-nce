<p>Lesson 127 A famous actress著名的女演员</p>
<p>课文详注 Further notes on the text</p>
<p>1．I thought so.我也这样想。</p>
<p>so 是代词，意为&ldquo;这样&rdquo;、&ldquo;如此&rdquo;。 I think so的否定式为I don't think so（我不这样认为）。类似用so的短句如：</p>
<p>I hope so. 我希望如此。</p>
<p>I expect so. 我期待如此。</p>
<p>I told you so. 我这么告诉过你的。</p>
<p>2．have another look,再（仔细）看一眼。</p>
<p>3． look old,看上去老。这里look是系动词，后跟表语。</p>
<p>4．at least,至少。</p>
<p>5．I'm sure she is.我肯定她有40岁了。 其后省略了 at least forty。</p>
<p>6．not more than twenty-nine myself,我自己还没29岁。</p>
<p>其中not more than是&ldquo;不超过&rdquo;、&ldquo;不到&rdquo;的意思。这里反身代词myself是I的同位语，用来加强语气。</p>
<p>She did it herself. 这事是她自己做的。</p>
<p>语法 Grammar in use&nbsp;</p>
<p>表示猜测和推断的情态助动词must和can't（1）</p>
<p>表示最有力的推论的最常用的形式是must和can't。这时，它们一般与系动词be连用。肯定的推断用 must be来表示，否定的推断用 can't be来表示，而不用mustn't。请看例句：</p>
<p>He can't be a doctor. He must be a dentist.</p>
<p>他不会是个医生。他一定是位牙医。</p>
<p>She can't be Danish. She must be Norwegian.</p>
<p>她不会是丹麦人。她一定是挪威人。</p>
<p>He can't be shaving. He must be having a bath.</p>
<p>他不可能在剃胡子。他一定是在洗澡。</p>
<p>It can't be cheap. It must be expensive.</p>
<p>它不会便宜。一定价格昂贵。</p>
<p>He can't be ill. He must be tired.</p>
<p>他不可能生病了。他肯定是累了。</p>
