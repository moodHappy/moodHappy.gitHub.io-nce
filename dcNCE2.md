**§ Lesson 1 A private conversation 私人谈话**

【New words and expressions】 生词和短语

★private   adj.私人的  

如果妈妈想看你的信, 你可以说 : It's my private letter.

如果陌生人想进你的房子, 你可以说 : It's my private house.

private life 私生活

由此引申出privacy n.隐私 : private life 私生活

It’s privacy.这是我的隐私!(不愿让别人知道的)

新东方是private school(私立学校), 与此相反, 公立学校是public school.所以, private的反义词是public.

eg.public 公众; public letter 公开信; public place 公共场所

private还有一个值得注意的意思 : 普通的. 

如 : private citizen 普通公民:I’m a private citizen.

private soldier 大兵; 

我们熟悉的《拯救大兵瑞恩》就是《Private Ryan》

★conversation  n.谈话

subject of conversation : 话题(天气是英国人最喜爱的话题)

几种谈话 : 

1、talk 内容可正式可不正式, 也可以私人 : Let’s have a talk.

3、dialogue 对话, 可以指正式国家与国家会谈 : China and Korea are having a dialogue.

4、chat 闲聊, 就是北京人说的 “侃” , 说的是无关紧要的事. 

5、gossip 嚼舌头, 说长道短

have a + talk/chat/dialogue/conversation/gossip 名词变动词

★seat    n.座位  

这个词很重要, 考试常考. 

have a good seat,这里的seat指place(指地点不错), 而不是chair. 

take a seat/take your seat 坐下来, 就坐

下面这个句子在口语、电影里很常见 : Is the seat taken?(这个位置有人吗?)

考点 : 作为动词的seat与sit的区别

sit--vi; seat—vt

eg: He is sitting there.他住在那儿. 

You seat him.你给他找个位置. 

seat sb 让某人就坐,后面会加人

eg: seat yourselft.

Seat him.

本课重点 : 过去进行时, 一般过去时

一般过去时与现在完成时

共同点 : 动作在过去都做过了. 

区别 : 过去式只能强调过去的事, 和现在没有任何关系. 

I ate a piece of bread.

现在完成时, 过去的事情对现在产生的影响. 

I have eaten a piece of bread this morning.I'm not hungry.

The clock stopped.陈述事实

The clock has stopped.过去的事实对现在造成影响

The plane was late 飞机晚(点)了

....were waiting... 故事背景, 用进行时态

They were expecting...期待着心理上的等

a valuable parcel of diamonds

South Africa 南非

a few hours earlier 几个小时以前

someone had told...过去完成时, 过去以前发生的事情

would+do 过去将来时,间接方式, 转述, 站在过去看未来

that 从句.典型的宾语从句, 起转述作用

steal sth.

one...the other.../some...others...　

others=other+名词复数

...the plane arrived,...were waiting inside the main building

while others were waiting on...

when; while 当……时候

while能用when代替; 　但是when却不一定能用while代替.

while+从句, 动作一定会延续

when+延续性动词/瞬间动词; when he arrived

when he died

when,while强调动作同时发生

过去进行时 : 

在过去的某一点时间, 或者是过去某一动作同时发生的另外一个动作

瞬间动词(arrive)无进行时态

I am arriving 进行时态表示将要

When he arrived,I was having dinner.

同时发生的两个动作, 均用过去进行时

When I was doing my homework,my mother was cooking.

When my mother was doing the housework,my father was watching TV.

同时发生的两个动作

1\.一个用一般过去时, 另一个用过去进行时

2\.分工的情况, 均用过去进行时

When the plane arrived,...were waiting inside the main building

while others were waiting on...

take sth.off...=take sth.away from...

and carried it into...carried 表示看得很重

Customs House 海关

While...

...were keeping guard at the door,two others opened the parcel.

表面上是分工, 两个动作同时发生, 不是同时开始同时结束, 延续时间不一致, 

长一点时间的动作用进行时态, 短时间的动作用过去时.

When someone knocked at the door,I was having dinner.

keep guard 守卫; at the door 在门边(固定搭配)

two others=two other detectives

To their surprise

to one's surprise,让某人惊讶的是

To my surprise,the teacher was late.

The cup is full of water.

总结

a few hours ealier 几个小时以前

two others

to one's surprise,...

be full of 装满

重点 : 过去动作同时发生的时态

1\.过去两个动作同时发生, 习惯上一个用一般过去时, 另一个用过去进行时

; 动作长用过去进行时, 动作短用一般过去时; 分工的情况, 动作的开始时间和

结束时间几乎相同, 均用过去进行时; 

`　`I was listening to the radio,my sister was dancing.

2\.两个动作在同时段进行, 在不同时间结束, 先发生的动作未结束, 另一个动作

发生, 先发生的动作用进行时态, 另一个动作用过去时.

When the telephone rang,I was opening the door.先开门

When the telephone was ringing, I opened the door.　电话先响

3\.瞬间动词没有进行时态, 所以两个动作同时发生, 延续性动词用进行时态, 瞬间

动词使用过去时态.

先行词是主句和从句共同有的一个词

answer : d

see sb. doing : 看见某人正在做某事;  see sb. do : 看见某人做某事

hear : 听见

notice sb. doing / notice sb. do ; watch sb. doing / watch sb. do

a. much  b. very  c. many  d. too

answer: d

too...to...: 太...以至于不能... / ...enough to...: 足以用来做某事

many 应加+名词 / much, very 一般不会与 to 连用

8  He hasn't regretted it. He \_\_\_\_\_\_ it.

a. isn't sorry about  b. doesn't pity  c. isn't pleased with  d. doesn't laugh about

answer: a

be sorry about: 为什么感到遗憾(抱歉) / be pleasued with: 对什么感到满意 / laugh at : 嘲笑

laugh about:为什么原因而笑

b. pity 不对是由于词性不对

11  The thief dropped the bag. He \_\_\_\_\_\_.

重点说明 : 

It's easy to recognize

the apple is sweet enough to eat

如果一个不定式的前面是一个形容词, 如果主句的结局是系表结构+to, 不定式当中常用主动表被动, 在不定式的表达方式当中, 动词的宾语如果刚好是这句话的主语, 这个宾语一定不能出现

the apple is too sour to eat.(sour adj [5saJE(r)] 酸的)

......to answer the question  这个小孩足够聪明以至于能回答这个问题, “the question” 不是主语故一定要出现

the question is easy enough to answer.

文中 “...easy to recognize(car)” 因car是主语, 所以不能出现

在不定式当中, 也许有可能用主动表达被动含义, 及物动词后面一般加宾语(这个宾语就是这句话的主语就不加), 又如 : the clothes are too comfortable to ware.

【Special difficulties】难点

so/such如此

such...that.../so...that...如此以致于

so+形容词(副词)+that.../such+(a, an修饰词或形容词)+名词+that

一旦有名词, 就认为形容词修饰的是名词, 前面的词也修饰的是名词

如果名词是可数名词单数才要加a和an, 反过来如果是可数名词单数, 前面一定要加a或an

Exercise 练习  用so, such或such a填空 : 

1  He ran \_\_\_\_\_\_ quickly that I could not catch him.

1、so  2、such a  3、so  4、such  5、so  6、such a  7、such an  8、such a

如果形容词是表示数量的(many, much, little, few), 一律用so

there is so little time left that we must hurry.

there is such a little(小) bird that I can't see it.(“little” 不会和可数名词连用, 如连用不会译成 “数量少” , 而应译为 “小” )

he is so lazy a boy/he is such a lazy boy.

如果有几个以上的形容词共同修饰一个名词的时候, 冠词放在第一位, 这句话中冠词不放在第一位, 说明 “a” 与 “boy” 有关系, “lazy” 从意思上与 “boy” 有关系, 但从强调点上与 “boy” 没关系, 它的强调点在 “lazy” 上

such+冠词+形容词+名词/so+形容词+冠词+名词

它们的主语一定是物, 不是人: Your hair needs cuting.

need to be done---主语是人,也可以是物

区别:
1\.同位语从句后的that是起解释说明的作用, 而定语从句是起修饰作用
2\.that在从句中做主语或宾语成分,则是定语从句; that在从句中不能做主语或宾语成分,则是同位语从句

【Composition】 作文

用括号中的连词改写以下句子 : 

1  I put the cake in the oven. I forgot all about it. (After putting)

2  Two hours had passed.I smelled something burning.(When)

3  I went into the kitchen.I found it full of smoke.(On going)

1 After putting the cake in the oven, I forgot all about it.

2 .....(time)passed, and then.....

.....(time)passed, before.....

Two hours had passed when I smelled something burning.

一般不会把 “when” 放在 “.....(time)passed.....” 之前, 这是一种习惯

something burning: burning放在不定代词后面, “-ing” 表主动关系, 即表示东西正在燃烧. 

3 On going into the kitchen, I found it full of smoke.

1  Did the writer return home from the shops or not?What did she begin to make?(As soon as)

2  Did the telephone ring soon afterwards or not? Were her hugers very sticky or not?(When)

3  How long did she spend talking to Helen Bates on the telephone?

4  Did she look at the mess she had made or not?(After that)

5  What was covered with pastry?

6  Who rang the doorbell?(Just then)

7  What did he want her to do?

1 as soon as:时间状语从句引导词

`  `as soon as = when

`  `as soon as 强调这个动作一发生, 立即就发生了另一个动作

`  `when 不强调两个动作紧密相连

4 after 作介词, 后接名词或代词作宾语

`        `作连词, 后接句子

文中 “that” 为代词, “after that” 仅为介词短语

补充P237 lesson 50 summary writing

1  Where did the writer want to go? Did he know the way or not? What did the conductor promise to do? (but as)

1 “but as” 并不是并列短语, 两者连在一起仅仅是巧合

The writer wanted to go to Woodfast Green but as he did not know the way, the conductor promised to tell him where to get off.

第一句和第二句之间是 “but” 关系, 第二句和第三句之间为 “as” 关系, 所以产生 “but as”

保留一个句子做主句, 其他的变成非谓语动词

非谓语动词采用何种形式, 则根据其与主语的关系, 如果是主动关系, 用ing, 被动关系, 则用动词的ed形式

【Summary writing】摘要写作

` `Answer these questions in not more than 80  words. 

回答下列问题, 将答案组成一个段落, 不要超过80个单词. 

1  Did the woman in jeans hesitate for a moment or not? Did she enter an expensive shop or not? What did she ask to see? (Though ... and)

2  What did an assistant tell her? When did the woman return? Was she dressed in a fur coat or not? (On being told by)

3  What was the assistant eager to do this time?

4  What did she make him bring her? What did the woman finally buy? (After making)

1、第一步写单句, though后面要加一个从句, 第一个句子和第二个都做主句并列, 则though 后面还有第三个从句, though后面有从句是第一个和第二个并列, 但还有个主句

Though the woman in jeans hesitated for a moment,she entered an expensive shop and asked for/to see the dress in the shop window.

2、by +主动语态中的主语

On being told by an assistant that the dress was sold,

① the woman returned the following morning dressed in a fur coat.

② when the woman returned ,she was dressed in a fur coat. / the woman returned , when she was dressed in a fur coat. 前后两句的强调点不同, 本句中应强调 “return” , 故后面一句更好, 这属于tiny mistake(微小的错误), 当然第一句最好, 另外应注意句子的平衡, 也应将 “when” 放后面

4、make sb do

After making the assistant bring......,the women finally bought the dress she had......

The woman finally bought what she had first asked for. 也对!
