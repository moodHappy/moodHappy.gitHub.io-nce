<p>【Text】</p>
<p>Jeremy Hampden has a large circle of friends and is very popular at parties. Everybody admires him for his great sense of humour -- everybody, that is, except his six-year-old daughter, Jenny. Recently, one of Jeremy's closest friends asked him to make a speech at a wedding reception. This is the sort of thing that Jeremy loves. He prepared the speech carefully and went to the wedding with Jenny. He had included a large number of funny stories in the speech and, of course, it was a great success. As soon as he had finished, Jenny told him she wanted to go home. Jeremy was a little disappointed by this but he did as his daughter asked. On the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech. To his surprise, she said she hadn't. Jeremy asked her why this was so and she told him that she did not like to see so many people laughing at him!</p>

<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->间接引语：祈使句的转述<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->（1）在第15课与第39课的语法中，我们分别学习了陈述句和疑问句变为间接引语的情况，它们基本上都是引述词(say, tell 等)+（间接宾语）+从句：<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries.<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>

<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->转述这类祈使句的否定形式时，必须将not放在带to的不定式之前：<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->I advise you not to buy her anything.<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->我建议你别给她买任何东西。<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->（3）动词suggest和insist用于转述建议、要求时，其结构为suggest/insist+that从句（用should）。<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
