<p>【Text】</p>
<p>A woman in jeans stood at the window of an expensive shop. Though she hesitated for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window. The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed. Glancing at her scornfully, he told her that the dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant next day. She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other. After seeking out the rude assistant, she asked for the same dress. Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time. With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress. As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did not like it. She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window before finally buying the dress she had first asked for.</p>
<p>参考译文</p>
<p>一位穿着牛仔裤的妇女站在一家高档商店的橱窗前. 她虽然犹豫了片刻, 但终于还是走进了商店, 要求把陈列在橱窗里的一件衣服拿给她看. 接待她的售货员不喜欢她的那副打扮, 轻蔑地看了她一眼后, 便告诉她那件衣服已经卖出去了. 这位妇女怒气冲冲地走出了商店, 决定第二天教训一下那个售货员. 第二天上午, 她又来到这家商店, 穿了一件裘皮大衣, 一只手拎着一只手提包, 另一只手拿着一把长柄伞. 找到那个无礼的售货员后, 她还要看昨天的那件衣服. 那个售货员没有认出她是谁, 这一回接待她的态度非常殷勤. 费了好大劲几, 他爬进橱窗去取那件衣服. 这位妇女对那件衣服只看一眼, 就说不喜欢. 她开心地迫使那位售货员把橱窗里几乎所有的东西都拿了出来, 最后才买下了她最先要看的那一件.&nbsp;</p>

<p>a woman in jeans 一个穿牛仔裤的妇女</p>
<p>2、Though she hesitated for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window.</p>

<p>Why is your aunt dressed in black?</p>

<p>Seek him out quickly. I want to speak to him.</p>
<p>6、Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not being able to open the door, I asked my neighbour for help.</p>

<p>【Summary writing】</p>
<p>1&nbsp;Did the woman in jeans hesitate for a moment or not? Did she enter an expensive shop or not? What did she ask to see? (Though ... and)</p>
<p>2&nbsp;What did an assistant tell her? When did the woman return? Was she dressed in a fur coat or not? (On being told by)</p>
<p>3&nbsp;What was the assistant eager to do this time?</p>
<p>4&nbsp;What did she make him bring her? What did the woman finally buy? (After making)</p>
<p>1、Though the woman in jeans hesitated for a moment,she entered an expensive shop and asked for/to see the dress in the shop window.</p>
<p>第一步写单句, though后面要加一个从句, 第一个句子和第二个都做主句并列, 则though 后面还有第三个从句, though后面有从句是第一个和第二个并列, 但还有个主句</p>
<p>2、On being told by an assistant that the dress was sold,</p>
<p>① The woman returned the following morning dressed in a fur coat.</p>
<p>② When the woman returned ,she was dressed in a fur coat. / the woman returned , when she was dressed in a fur coat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>by +主动语态中的主语</p>
<p>前后两句的强调点不同, 本句中应强调 &ldquo;return&rdquo; , 故后面一句更好, 这属于tiny mistake(微小的错误), 当然第一句最好, 另外应注意句子的平衡, 也应将 &ldquo;when&rdquo; 放后面</p>
<p>4、After making the assistant bring&hellip;, the women finally bought the dress she had......</p>
<p>The woman finally bought what she had first asked for. 也对!</p>
<p>【Letter writing】&nbsp;</p>
<p>在信的开头常的下面两个句型：</p>
<p>What a surprise it was to &hellip;</p>
<p>What a surprise it was to send me flowers.</p>
<p>在to do sth. 的结构当中，可以在前面表达动作由谁做, 加一个&ldquo;for sb.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important for me to do sth. （&ldquo;for&rdquo; 一定要加在 &ldquo;to&rdquo; 的前面）</p>
<p>What a surprise it was for you to send me flowers.</p>
<p>Forgive me for not writing earlier, but &hellip; 我很抱歉我这么久没给你写信</p>
<p>I apologize. / I do apologize. 我真的很抱歉!(do 其强调作用)</p>
<p>You apology is accepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>【Key structures】　</p>
<p>At, In, Off and With</p>
<p>在表示地点和位置时，说话人的个人角度会影响对介词的选择。at通常用于表示居住地点和某个停留地点、工作地点等，而in表示里面或包围的含义：</p>
<p>I'll see you at the station. 我将到车站送你.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the way home, we stopped at a small village called Puddleton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were a lot of people in the street. 街上有许多人.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's go for a walk in the park. 让我们到公园去散散步.&nbsp;</p>
<p>off常与动词连用，表示位置的变化，即&ldquo;与&hellip;&hellip;分离&rdquo;，可译为&ldquo;脱掉，脱落&rdquo;（相当于away from或down from的意思）等，其反义词为on：</p>
<p>The lid came off easily. 这个盖子很容易掉.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pencil rolled off the table. 铅笔滚到桌子下面去了.&nbsp;</p>
<p>描写人时，in通常用于表示穿着，后面加衣服或颜色，with则表示身上的某个具体特征或随身带着、拿着什么：</p>
<p>He looks handsome in that uniform.</p>
<p>That man with long hair is supposed to be a poet. 那个留着长发的男人应该是个诗人.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The police are looking for a man with a scar on his face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woman with the brown handbag and long umbrella is a famous novelist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A child came along with a brown dog.</p>
<p>【Special Difficulties】&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make and Let</p>
<p>make和let后面都跟不带to的不定式，但意义上和用法上有区别：</p>
<p>make+名词/代词+不带to的不定式，表示&ldquo;迫使，致使&rdquo;：</p>
<p>She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window.</p>
<p>What made him change his mind?</p>
<p>That beard makes you look much older than you really are.</p>
<p>在被动语态中含有上述意义的make后面必须带to：</p>
<p>He was made to work fourteen hours a day.</p>
<p>He was made to change his mind.</p>
<p>let用于祈使句，建议包括说话者在内的人采取某一行动：</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not waste any more time.</p>
<p>其否定形式除&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not&hellip;&rdquo;外也可以用&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;：</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s waste any more time.</p>
<p>let+名词/代词+不带to的不定式，表示&ldquo;允许&rdquo;：</p>
<p>Don't let him persuade you. 不要让他把你说服了.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me try. 让我试一拭.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't let the children touch anything in this room please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>如果宾语是us，则不能缩写成let&rsquo;s：</p>
<p>Please let us have more time, will you?</p>
<p>let后面可以跟一个被动的、不带to的不定式：</p>
<p>He let it be known that the house was his.</p>
<p>但let一般不用于被动意义来表示&ldquo;被允许&rdquo;，这时可用allow。</p>
<p>We were not allowed to speak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. other b.next c. after d. else</p>
<p>else放在不定代词或疑问代词后面, who else，anyone else，else不跟名词</p>
