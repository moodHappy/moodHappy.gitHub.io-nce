<p>Chapter 1/p>
<p>　　MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice./p>
<p> At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs./p>
<p> The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point./p>
<p> Every year during the month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions./p>
<p> First they brought the magnet./p>
<p> A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, put on a bold public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned al-chemists of Macedonia./p>
<p> He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots and everybody was amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down from their places and beams creak from the desperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even objects that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had been searched for most and went dragging along in turbulent confusion behind Melquíades' magical irons./p>
<p> “Things have a life of their own,” the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accent./p>
<p> “It's simply a matter of waking up their souls./p>
<p>” José Arcadio Buendía, whose unbridled imagination always went beyond the genius of nature and even beyond miracles and magic, thought that it would be possible to make use of that useless invention to extract gold from the bowels of the earth./p>
<p> Melquíades, who was an honest man, warned him: “It won't work for that./p>
<p>” But José Arcadio Buendía at that time did not believe in the honesty of gypsies, so he traded his mule and a pair of goats for the two magnetized ingots./p>
<p> Úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who relied on those animals to increase their poor domestic holdings, was unable to dissuade him./p>
<p> “Very soon well have gold enough and more to pave the floors of the house,” her husband replied./p>
<p> For several months he worked hard to demonstrate the truth of his idea./p>
<p> He explored every inch of the region, even the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots along and reciting Melquíades' incantation aloud./p>
<p> The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit of fifteenth-century armor which had all of its pieces soldered together with rust and inside of which there was the hollow resonance of an enormous stone-filled gourd./p>
<p> When José Arcadio Buendía and the four men of his expedition managed to take the armor apart, they found inside a calcified skeleton with a copper locket containing a woman's hair around its neck./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　In March the gypsies returned./p>
<p> This time they brought a telescope and a magnifying glass the size of a drum, which they exhibited as the latest discovery of the Jews of Amsterdam./p>
<p> They placed a gypsy woman at one end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance to the tent./p>
<p> For the price of five reales, people could look into the telescope and see the gypsy woman an arm's length away./p>
<p> “Science has eliminated distance,” Melquíades proclaimed./p>
<p> “In a short time, man will be able to see what is happening in any place in the world without leaving his own house./p>
<p>” A burning noonday sun brought out a startling demonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass: they put a pile of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun's rays./p>
<p> José Arcadio Buendía, who had still not been consoled for the failure of big magnets, conceived the idea of using that invention as a weapon of war./p>
<p> Again Melquíades tried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted the two magnetized ingots and three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass./p>
<p> Úrsula wept in consternation./p>
<p> That money was from a chest of gold coins that her father had put together ova an entire life of privation and that she had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper occasion to make use of it./p>
<p> José Arcadio Buendía made no attempt to console her, completely absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abnegation of a scientist and even at the risk of his own life./p>
<p> In an attempt to show the effects of the glass on enemy troops, he exposed himself to the concentration of the sun's rays and suffered burns which turned into sores that took a long time to heal./p>
<p> Over the protests of his wife, who was alarmed at such a dangerous invention, at one point he was ready to set the house on fire./p>
<p> He would spend hours on end in his room, calculating/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　the strategic possibilities of his novel weapon until he succeeded in putting together a manual of startling instructional clarity and an irresistible power of conviction./p>
<p> He sent it to the government, accompanied by numerous descriptions of his experiments and several pages of explanatory sketches; by a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in measureless swamps, forded stormy rivers, and was on the point of perishing under the lash of despair, plague, and wild beasts until he found a route that joined the one used by the mules that carried the mail./p>
<p> In spite of the fact that a trip to the capital was little less than impossible at that time, José Arcadio Buendía promised to undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so that he could put on some practical demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities and could train them himself in the complicated art of solar war./p>
<p> For several years he waited for an answer./p>
<p> Finally, tired of waiting, he bemoaned to Melquíades the failure of his project and the gypsy then gave him a convincing proof of his honesty: he gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and he left him in addition some Portuguese maps and several instruments of navigation./p>
<p> In his own handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of the studies by Monk Hermann./p>
<p> which he left José Arcadio so that he would be able to make use of the astrolabe, the compass, and the sextant./p>
<p> José Arcadio Buendía spent the long months of the rainy season shut up in a small room that he had built in the rear of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments./p>
<p> Having completely abandoned his domestic obligations, he spent entire nights in the courtyard watching the course of the stars and he almost contracted sunstroke from trying to establish an exact method to ascertain noon./p>
<p> When he became an expert in the use and manipulation of his instruments, he conceived a notion of space that allowed him to navigate across unknown seas, to visit uninhabited territories, and to establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study./p>
<p> That was the period in which he acquired the habit of talking to himself, of walking through the house without paying attention to anyone, as Úrsula and the children broke their backs in the garden, growing banana and caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and eggplants./p>
<p> Suddenly, with-out warning, his feverish activity was interrupted and was replaced by a kind of fascination./p>
<p> He spent several days as if he were bewitched, softly repeating to himself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his own understanding./p>
<p> Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunchtime, all at once he released the whole weight of his torment./p>
<p> The children would remember for the rest of their lives the august solemnity with which their father, devastated by his prolonged vigil and by the wrath of his imagination, revealed his discovery to them:/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　“The earth is round, like an orange./p>
<p>”/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　Úrsula lost her patience./p>
<p> “If you have to go crazy, please go crazy all by yourself!” she shouted./p>
<p> “But don't try to put your gypsy ideas into the heads of the children./p>
<p>” José Arcadio Buendía, impassive, did not let himself be frightened by the desperation of his wife, who, in a seizure of rage, mashed the astrolabe against the floor./p>
<p> He built another one, he gathered the men of the village in his little room, and he demonstrated to them, with theories that none of them could understand, the possibility of returning to where one had set out by consistently sailing east./p>
<p> The whole village was convinced that José Arcadio Buendía had lost his reason, when Melquíades returned to set things straight./p>
<p>He gave public praise to the intelligence of a man who from pure astronomical speculation had evolved a theory that had already been proved in practice, although unknown in Macondo until then, and as a proof of his admiration he made him a gift that was to have a profound influence on the future of the village: the laboratory of an alchemist./p>
<p> By then Melquíades had aged with surprising rapidity./p>
<p> On his first trips he seemed to be the same age as José Arcadio Buendía./p>
<p> But while the latter had preserved his extraordinary strength, which permitted him to pull down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse by some tenacious illness./p>
<p> It was, in reality, the result of multiple and rare diseases contracted on his innumerable trips around the world./p>
<p> According to what he himself said as he spoke to José/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　Arcadio Buendía while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the cuffs of his pants, but never deciding to give him the final clutch of its claws./p>
<p> He was a fugitive from all the plagues and catastrophes that had ever lashed mankind./p>
<p> He had survived pellagra in Persia, scurvy inthe Malayan archipelago , leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, bubonic plague in Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a disastrous shipwreck in the Strait of Magel-lan./p>
<p> That prodigious creature, said to possess the keys of Nostradamus, was a gloomy man, enveloped in a sad aura, with an Asiatic look that seemed to know what there was on the other side of things./p>
<p> He wore a large black hat that looked like a raven with widespread wings, and a velvet vest across which the patina of the centuries had skated./p>
<p> But in spite of his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth, he had a human burden, an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily life./p>
<p> He would complain of the ailments of old age, he suffered from the most insignificant economic difficulties, and he had stopped laughing a long time back because scurvy had made his teeth drop out./p>
<p> On that suffocating noontime when the gypsy revealed his secrets, José Arcadio Buendía had the certainty that it was the beginning of a great friendship./p>
<p> The children were startled by his fantastic stories./p>
<p> Aureliano, who could not have been more than five at the time, would remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and quivering light from the window, lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest reaches of the imagination, while down over his temples there flowed the grease that was being melted by the heat./p>
<p> José Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary memory to all of his descendants./p>
<p> Úrsula on the other hand, held a bad memory of that visit, for she had entered the room just as Melquíades had carelessly broken a flask of bichloride of mercury./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　“It's the smell of the devil,” she said./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　“Not at all,” Melquíades corrected her./p>
<p> “It has been proven that the devil has sulphuric properties and this is just a little corrosive sublimate./p>
<p>”/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　Always didactic, he went into a learned exposition of the diabolical properties of cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention to him, although she took the children off to pray./p>
<p> That biting odor would stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of Melquíades./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　The rudimentary laboratory–in addition to a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and sieves–was made up of a primitive water pipe, a glass beaker with a long, thin neck, a reproduction of the philosopher's egg, and a still the gypsies themselves had built in accordance with modern descriptions of the three-armed alembic of Mary the Jew./p>
<p> Along with those items, Melquíades left samples of the seven metals that corresponded to the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold, and a set of notes and sketches concerning the processes of the Great Teaching that would permit those who could interpret them to undertake the manufacture of the philosopher's stone./p>
<p> Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the quantity of gold, José Arcadio Buendía paid court to Úrsula for several weeks so that she would let him dig up her colonial coins and increase them by as many times as it was possible to subdivide mercury./p>
<p> Úrsula gave in, as always, to her husband's unyielding obstinacy./p>
<p> Then José Arcadio Buendía threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings, orpiment, brimstone, and lead./p>
<p> He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil until he got a thick and pestilential syrup which was more like common caramel than valuable gold./p>
<p> In risky and desperate processes of distillation, melted with the seven planetary metals, mixed with hermetic mercury and vitriol of Cyprus, and put back to cook in hog fat for lack of any radish oil, Úrsula's precious inheritance was reduced to a large piece of burnt hog cracklings that was firmly stuck to the bottom of the pot./p>
<p> When the gypsies came back, Úrsula had turned the whole population of the village against them./p>
<p> But curiosity was greater than fear, for that time the gypsies went about the town making a deafening noise with all manner of musical instruments while a hawkeran nounced the exhibition of the most fabulous discovery of the Naciancenes./p>
<p> So that everyone went to the tent and by paying one cent they saw a youthful Mel-quíades, recovered, unwrinkled, with a new and flashing set of teeth./p>
<p> Those who remembered his gums that had been destroyed by scurvy, his flaccid cheeks, and his withered lips trembled with fear at the final proof of the gypsy's supernatural power./p>
<p> The fear turned into panic when Melquíades took out his teeth, intact, encased in their gums, and showed them to the audience for an instant–a fleeting instant in which he went back to being the same decrepit man of years past–and put them back again and smiled once more with the full control of his restored youth./p>
<p> Even José Arcadio Buen-día himself considered that Melquíades' knowledge had reached unbearable extremes, but he felt a healthy excitement when the gypsy explained to him atone the workings of his false teeth./p>
<p> It seemed so simple and so prodigious at the same time that overnight he lost all interest in his experiments in alchemy./p>
<p> He underwent a new crisis of bad humor./p>
<p> He did not go back to eating regularly, and he would spend the day walking through the house./p>
<p> “Incredible things are happening in the world,” he said to Úrsula./p>
<p> “Right/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　there across the river there are all kinds of magical instruments while we keep on living like donkeys./p>
<p>” Those who had known him since the foundation of Macondo were startled at how much he had changed under Melquíades' influence./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　At first José Arcadio Buendía had been a kind of youthful patriarch who would give instructions for plant-ing and advice for the raising of children and animals, and who collaborated with everyone, even in the physical work, for the welfare of the community./p>
<p> Since his house from the very first had been the best in the village, the others had been built in its image and likeness./p>
<p> It had a small, well-lighted living roost, a dining room in the shape of a terrace with gaily colored flowers, two bedrooms, a courtyard with a gigantic chestnut tree, a well kept garden, and a corral where goats, pigs, and hens lived in peaceful communion./p>
<p> The only animals that were prohibited, not just in his house but in the entire settlement, were fighting cocks./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　Úrsula's capacity for work was the same as that of her husband./p>
<p> Active, small, severe, that woman of un-breakable nerves who at no moment in her life had been heard to sing seemed to be everywhere, from dawn until quite late at night, always pursued by the soft whispering of her stiff, starched petticoats./p>
<p> Thanks to her the floors of tamped earth, the unwhitewashed mud walls, the rustic, wooden furniture they had built them-selves were always dean, and the old chests where they kept their clothes exhaled the warm smell of basil./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　José Arcadio Buendía, who was the most enterprising man ever to be seen in the village, had set up the placement of the houses in such a way that from all of them one could reach the river and draw water with the same effort, and he had lined up the streets with such good sense that no house got more sun than another during the hot time of day./p>
<p> Within a few years Macondo was a village that was more orderly and hard working than any known until then by its three hundred inhabitants./p>
<p> It was a truly happy village where no one was over thirty years of age and where no one had died./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　Since the time of its founding, José Arcadio Buendía had built traps and cages./p>
<p> In a short time he filled not only his own house but all of those in the village with troupials, canaries, bee eaters, and redbreasts./p>
<p> The concert of so many different birds became so disturbing that Úrsula would plug her ears with beeswax so as not to lose her sense of reality./p>
<p> The first time that Melquíades' tribe arrived, selling glass balls for headaches, everyone was surprised that they had been able to find that village lost in the drowsiness of the swamp, and the gypsies confessed that they had found their way by the song of the birds./p>
<p> That spirit of social initiative disappearedin a short time, pulled away by the fever of the magnets, the astronomical calculations, the dreams of transmutation, and the urge to discover the wonders of the world./p>
<p> From a clean and active man,José Arcadio Buendía changed into a man lazy in appearance, careless in his dress, with a wild beard that Úrsula managed to trim with great effort and a kitchen knife./p>
<p> There were many who considered him the victim of some strange spell./p>
<p> But even those most convinced of his madness left work and family to follow him when he brought out his tools to clear the land and asked the assembled group to open a way that would put Macondo in contact with the great inventions./p>
<p>/p>
<p>/p>
<p>　　José Arcadio Buendía was completely ignorant of the geography of the region./p>
<p> He knew that to the east there lay an impenetrable mountain chain and that on the other side of the mountains there was the ardent city of Riohacha, where in times past–according to what he had been told by the first Aureliano Buendía, his grandfather–Sir Francis Drake had gone crocodile hunting with cannons and that he repaired hem and stuffed them with straw to bring to Queen Elizabeth./p>
<p> In his youth, José Arcadio Buendía and his men, with wives and children, animals and all kinds of domestic implements, had crossed the mountains in search of an outlet to the sea, and after twenty-six months
