<p>Chapter 1 Fotheringhay</p>
<p>第一章 福瑟临黑</p>
<p>My name is Bess Curle, but this is not my story．It is the story of my lady Mary, Queen of Scots．She wrote the story, and then she gave it to me．I am going to give it to her son．</p>
<p>我的名字叫贝斯&middot;柯尔，但这不是我的故事。它是有关我的夫人玛丽苏格兰女王的故事。她写下了这个故事，便交给我。我将把它转交给她的儿子。</p>
<p>She began the story a week ago．It was January 1587, and we sat here in our cold room in Fotheringhay Castle, in the north of England．We couldn't see much from the window．One or two houses, a river, some trees, some horses, and a road．That's all．</p>
<p>她开始写这个故事是在一个星期以前。那是在1587年的1月，我们坐在英格兰北部福瑟临黑城堡中的一间寒冷的屋子里。透过窗户，我们看不到多少东西，一两幢房屋，一条河流，一些树木，几匹马和一条路，仅此而已。</p>
<p>The road goes to London, the home of Queen Elizabeth of England．Mary sat with her little dog in her hands and watched it, all day long．</p>
<p>这条路通往伦敦&mdash;&mdash;英格兰伊丽莎白女王的住宅。一整天玛丽都坐着，手里抱着她的小狗，两眼望着这条路。</p>
<p>No one came along the road．Nothing happened．I watched Mary, unhappily．</p>
<p>没有人从这条路上走来，什么也没有发生。我望着玛丽，心里很悲哀。</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, Your Majesty, come away from that window,'I said．&lsquo; It doesn't help．No one is going to come．Queen Eliza－beth can't do it&mdash;Queens don't kill Queens．'</p>
<p>&ldquo;陛下，请您离开那扇窗户吧，&rdquo;我说道。&ldquo;那没有用。不会有人来的。伊丽莎白女王不能那样做&mdash;&mdash;女王不杀女王的。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don't they, Bess?' mary said．&lsquo;Then why are we here, in this prison?Why am I not free?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;难道他们不会吗，贝斯？&rdquo;玛丽说。&ldquo;那我们为什么会在这里，坐在这个监狱里？为什么我不能自由？&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Your Majesty?Because Queen Elizabeth is afraid of you．'</p>
<p>&ldquo;您问为什么吗，陛下？那是因为伊丽莎白女王害怕您。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That's right,'mary said．&lsquo;She's afraid of me, and she hates me too．She hates me because I am beautiful, and she is not; because I had three husbands, and she never married．And because many people&mdash;good Catnolic people in England, France, Scotland, Spain&mdash;say that I, Mary, am the true Queen of England, not Elizabeth．And Elizabeth has no chil－dren, so, when she is dead, my son James&hellip;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;对极了，&rdquo;玛丽说。&ldquo;她怕我，并且还恨我。她恨我是因为我漂亮，而她不漂亮；是因为我有三个丈夫，而她从没有结婚。还因为许多人&mdash;&mdash;好心的英格兰、法国、苏格兰、西班牙的天主教教徒们说我玛丽才是英格兰真正的女王，而非伊丽莎白。伊丽莎白没有小孩，因此，她死后，我的儿子詹姆斯&hellip;&hellip;。&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came away from the window and stood in front of me．&lsquo;James,'she said quietly,&lsquo;my son．Does he think about me sometimes? He was only ten months old when I last saw him．It is nearly twenty years&hellip;'</p>
<p>她离开窗口走过来坐在我的面前。&ldquo;詹姆士，&rdquo;她平静地说，&ldquo;我的儿子。有时他会想起我吗？我最后一次见到他时他才10个月。都快20年了&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course he thinks about you, Your Majesty,'I said．&lsquo;You write to him often．How can he forget his mother?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;</p>
<p>他当然会想您的，陛下，&rdquo;我说。&ldquo;你经常给他写信，他怎么可能忘记自己的母亲呢？&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why doesn't he write to me?' mary asked．&lsquo;Does he want me to say here in an English prison?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;那为什么他不给我写信呢？&rdquo;玛丽问道。&ldquo;他想让我呆在英格兰监狱里吗？&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, of course not, Your Majesty．But&mdash;he has a lot of work, Your Majesty．He is the King of Scotland, and&hellip;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;不，当然不，陛下。可是&mdash;&mdash;他有许多事要做，陛下。他是苏格兰的国王，而且&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not the King of Scotland, Bess,'she said．&lsquo;Not be- fore I am dead．Remember that．'</p>
<p>&ldquo;他不是苏格兰国王，贝斯，&rdquo;她说。&ldquo;我没死，他就不是。记住这点。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Your Majesty, of course not．But perhaps people tell him things that are untrue．You know what people say．Per－haps&mdash;perhaps he thinks you killed his father．'</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，陛下，他当然不是。可是也许人们会告诉他一些不真实的情况。您知道人们会说什么。也许&mdash;&mdash;也许他认为是您杀死了他的父亲。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary's face went white．She was very angry, and for a minute I was afraid．She said:&lsquo;You know that's a lie, Bess．It is a lie！I did not kill James's father&mdash;I knew nothing about it！'</p>
<p>玛丽的脸一下子变白了。她很愤怒，那一会儿我真觉得害怕。她说：&ldquo;你知道那是个谎言，贝斯。那是个谎言！我没有杀死詹姆斯的父亲&mdash;&mdash;我对那一无所知！&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that,Your Majesty．But perhaps James doesn't know it．He hears so many lies, all the time．He needs to know the true story．Why don't you write, and tell him?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;我知道，陛下。可是也许詹姆斯不知道。他总是听到那么多谎言，他需要知道真实的情况。您为什么不写信告诉他呢？&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary sat down slowly．She looked old and tired．&lsquo;All right, Bess,'she said．&lsquo;Give me a pen, please．I'm going to write to James, and tell him the true story．You can give it to him when I'm dead．'</p>
<p>玛丽慢慢地坐了下来。她看起来又苍老又疲惫。&ldquo;好吧，贝斯，&rdquo;她说。&ldquo;请给我一枝笔，我这就给詹姆斯写信，告诉他真实的故事。我死后，你可以把信交给他。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead, Your Majesty? Don't say that．You aren't going to die．'</p>
<p>&ldquo;死？陛下，不要那样说。您不会死。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her old, tired eyes looked at me．&lsquo;Yes I am, Bess．You know what is going to happen．One day soon, a man is going to bring a letter from Queen Elizabeth．And then her men are going to kill me．But before I die, I would like to write to my son James．I want to tell him the story of my life．So give me a pen, please．'</p>
<p>她看着我眼神苍老而疲惫说道，&ldquo;不，我会死的，贝斯。你知道将会发生什么。不久的一天，一个人带来伊丽莎白女王的一封信。随后，她的人便杀了我。但在我死之前，我要给我的儿子詹姆斯写信。我要告诉他我一生的故事。来，给我一枝笔吧。&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave her a pen． This is what she wrote:</p>
<p>我拿给她一枝笔。这就是她所写的：</p>
<p>Chapter 2 France</p>
<p>Dear James. Very soon I am going to die, and meet my God. Before I die, I want to write the true story of my life for you. Everything that I write here is true&mdash;I cannot lie to you, or to God. Please believe that, James. It's important to me.</p>
<p>亲爱的詹姆斯，很快我就要死去，去见我的上帝了。在我死之前，我要给你写下我一生的真实的故事。在这里我写的一切都是真实的&mdash;&mdash;我不能对你说谎，也不能对上帝说谎。请相信这一切，詹姆斯，这对我很重要。</p>
<p>My father died when I was one week old, so I was the Queen of Scots when I was a baby. At first I lived with my mother in Scotland, and then, when I was five, I went to France. My mother was French, but she stayed in Scotland, and died there.</p>
<p>在我出生只有一个星期的时候我的父亲便去世了。因此在我还是个婴儿的时候我就成了苏格兰的女王。起初我和母亲一起住在苏格兰，后来在我五岁的时候我去了法国。我母亲是法国人，可是她却呆在苏格兰直到去世。</p>
<p>I went to France to marry the King of France's son. His name was Francis, and he was one year younger than me. In 1559, his father died, so Francis was King. Then I was Queen of France, and Queen of Scotland too.</p>
<p>我去法国并嫁给了法国王子。他叫弗朗西斯，比我小一岁。1559年，他的父亲去世了，因此弗朗西斯成了国王。于是，我既是法国王后，又是苏格兰女王。</p>
<p>I was very happy in France. Francis, my husband, was like a little brother to me. I think he loved me, bur he was very young, and he was often ill. And then, in 1560,he died. He was sixteen years old.</p>
<p>在法国我很幸福。我的丈夫弗朗西斯就像是我的一个小弟弟。我想他是爱我的，但是他太年轻了，还经常生病。之后，1560年，他死了，年仅16岁。</p>
<p>When he died I was very unhappy, and my life was very different. There was a new King and Queen, and I wasn't important in France, any more. But I was still Queen of Scots, so I came back to Scotland. When I arrived in Scotland, I was a young girl of eighteen. My mother was dead, and there was no one there to meet me. I walked off the ship, and I slept in a little house near the sea.</p>
<p>他死后我非常伤心，而且我的生活也发生了很大的变化。法国有了新的国王和王后，我在法国已显得不再重要。但是我仍然是苏格兰的女王，因此，我回到了苏格兰。我回到苏格兰的那会儿，我是个才18岁的小姑娘。我的母亲已经去世了，因此没有人来接我。我下了船，就在海边的一间小屋里过夜。</p>
<p>Next day, the Scots lords came from Edinburgh. They were pleased to see me, and for a week everyone was happy. People smiled at me and sang in the streets. I think everyone liked me. Then, that Sunday, I went to church.</p>
<p>第二天，苏格兰的贵族们从爱丁堡来了。他们见到我很高兴。有一个星期大家都很开心。人们朝我微笑，在大街上唱歌。我以为每个人都很喜欢我。然后，在那个星期天，我去了教堂。</p>
<p>James, my son, you are a Protestant and I am a Catholic. You are a good man, and you love God, but your church and my church are enemies. I was born a Catholic, and I am going to die a Catholic. I love God, too&mdash;I hope you understand that. I'm not going to change now.</p>
<p>詹姆斯，我的儿子，你是个新教徒而我是个天主教徒。你是好人，且热爱上帝，可是你的教会和我的教会是仇敌。我生为天主教徒，死也是天主教徒。我也爱上帝，&mdash;&mdash;我希望你能理解这些。即使现在我也不打算改变。</p>
<p>That Sunday, people shouted angrily in the streets. &rsquo;Your Majesty,' said the Scots lords. &rsquo;Scotland is a Protestant country. You can't go to a Catholic church here. The Scottish people don't like Catholics.'</p>
<p>那个星期天，人们在大街上愤怒地叫喊。&ldquo;陛下，&rdquo;那些苏格兰贵族们说道。&ldquo;苏格兰是个信奉新教的国家。你不能上这里的天主教教堂。苏格兰人民不喜欢天主教徒。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I'm sorry, my lords,' I said.&rsquo;But I am your Queen&mdash;no one tells me what to do. I don't hate Protestants, and I'm not going to kill them. The people can go to their Protestant churches, and pray to God there. But I'm going to pray with Catholics, in my church.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;很抱歉，我的勋爵们，&rdquo;我说。&ldquo;可我是你们的女王&mdash;&mdash;没有人能告诉我该怎样做。我不憎恨新教徒，也不会杀害他们。人们可以去他们的新教教堂，并在那里祈祷上帝。而我也将和天主教教徒们一起在我的教堂里向上帝祈祷。&rdquo;</p>
<p>People were angry because of that. A man called John Knox came to see me. He was a famous Protestant churchman, but I didn't like him. He was a big, angry man with black clothes. He hated the Catholic church, and wanted all Catholics to leave Scotland. To him, the Protestant church was the only true church of God. He said：&lsquo;Your Majesty, you're a young woman, like my daughter. Women can't understand difficult things like God or the church. Find a good Protestant husband, girl. Let him rule this country for you.'</p>
<p>人们听到这些发怒了。一个名叫约翰&bull;诺克斯的人来见我。他是个有名的新教教士，可我不喜欢他。他个头很大，怒气冲冲，穿着一身黑衣服。他憎恨天主教会，且想让所有的天主教教徒都离开苏格兰。对他来说，新教教会才是唯一真正属于上帝的教会。他说道：&ldquo;陛下，你是位年轻女子，就像我的女儿。女人是不会懂得诸如上帝、教会这类困难的事情的。找一个新教徒的好丈夫吧，女孩，让他来为你统治这个国家。&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was very angry with this man Knox. I was a Queen, but I was only eighteen. He didn't talk quietly&mdash;he shouted at me. I cried because of his angry words. I could not understand him&mdash;he talked so much, and he knew so many books. But I did not go to his church.</p>
<p>我对这个名叫诺克斯的男人很生气。我是女王，可我只有18岁。他没有平静地和我说话&mdash;&mdash;他对我大声叫嚷。由于他措词严厉，我哭了。我不能接受他&mdash;&mdash;虽然他说了那么多，并读过那么多书，但我不会去他的教堂。</p>
<p>He was right about one thing. Perhaps I could rule Scotland without a man, but I could not have a child without one. And every Queen needs a son or daughter to come after her. So I began to look for a husband.</p>
<p>可有一点他是对的。没有男人，或许我可以统治苏格兰，但没有男人，我就不会有小孩。每个女王都需要有个儿子或女儿来继承王位。因此我开始物色一个丈夫。</p>

<p>Chapter 3 Darnley and Riccio</p>
<p>At first I wanted to marry the son of the King of Spain, Don Carlos. But he was a Catholic, of course, and my Scots lords did not like that. It was difficult for me, James. I wanted to please myself. I wanted to please my friends and family in France and to please my people, too. And then there was the Queen of England.</p>
<p>开始的时候，我想嫁给西班牙国王的儿子，唐&bull;卡洛斯。可他是个天主教徒。当然，我的这些苏格兰贵族们不喜欢那样。这对我太难了，詹姆斯。我想让自己愉快，又想让我在法国的朋友和家人高兴，也想让我的人民满意。此外，还有英格兰女王。</p>
<p>At first I wanted very much to be friends with Elizabeth. We wrote many letters, and talked about a meeting&mdash;a meeting between two sister Queens. Elizabeth wrote to me at this time.</p>
<p>起初，我极想和伊丽莎白交朋友。我们通了很多信，并讨论有关会面的事宜&mdash;&mdash;两位姐妹女王之间的会面。这时，伊丽莎白给我写信道：</p>
<p>Our two countries need to be friends. You need a husband, I need a friend. Why not marry my friend Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester? He is a tall, strong man. I think he could be a good husband for you.</p>
<p>我们两个国家需要成为朋友。你需要一个丈夫，我需要一个朋友。为什么不嫁给我的朋友莱斯特伯爵罗伯特&bull;达德利呢？他高大健壮，我想他会成为你的好丈夫的。</p>
<p>I was very angry about this letter. There were a lot of stories about Elizabeth and Robert Dudley. They were good friends&mdash;he often danced and sang and talked with her. Sometimes, people said, he stayed in her room all night. Dudley had a wife, but one day she died very suddenly. It was an accident&mdash;she fell down the stairs, they say. But then, perhaps she was unhappy, because of her husband and Elizabeth.</p>
<p>对这封信我很恼火。关于伊丽莎白和罗伯特&bull;达德利之间有许多传闻。他们是好朋友&mdash;&mdash;他经常和她唱歌、跳舞、聊天。人们说他有时还一整夜呆在她的房间里。达德利有妻子，但有一天却突然死了。他们说那是一次意外事故&mdash;&mdash;她从楼上摔了下来。不过，也许她很不快乐，由于他丈夫和伊丽莎白的关系。</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she writes to me about a man like this! 'I thought.&rsquo; She wants him to marry me, because he is her friend&mdash;her lover, perhaps! She wants her lover to be King of Scotland!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;她写信给我介绍这样一个男人！&rdquo;我想。&ldquo;她想让他娶我，是因为他是她的朋友&mdash;&mdash;她的情人。或许，她想让她的情人成为苏格兰的国王！&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found a better man than Dudley, James. I found Henry Darnley, your father.</p>
<p>詹姆斯，我找到了一个比达德利好的男人，他就是你的父亲亨利&bull;达恩利。</p>
<p>He was nineteen years old, and I was twenty－three. He was a tall man, with a beautiful face and big green eyes. He talked and sang well, and I liked dancing with him. He often wore expensive black clothes, and he laughed a lot when he was with me. He was very young and friendly, and I felt happy when I was with him. I liked him very much, and I thought he loved me too.</p>
<p>他19岁，我23岁。他很高大，有一张英俊的脸庞和一双绿色的大眼睛。他说话很动听，歌也唱得好。我很喜欢和他一起跳舞。他经常穿一身高贵的黑色衣服，而且和我在一起时他常常面带微笑。他是那样的年轻和友善，和他在一起我感到很幸福。我非常喜欢他，我想他也爱我。</p>
<p>He was an important man, too. We were cousins&mdash;his grandfather was King of Scots, and his great grandfather was Henry VII of England.</p>
<p>他还是个很重要的人物。我们是堂姐弟&mdash;&mdash;他的祖父曾是苏格兰国王，他的曾祖父是英格兰的亨利二世。</p>
<p>In July 1565, I married him. Elizabeth was very angry, and so were a lot of the Scots lords. My half－brother, the Earl of Moray, tried to stop the marriage. I had to fight him, and he ran south, to England. But I was happy. Your father and I laughed, every day. He was now Henry, King of Scots.</p>
<p>1565年7月，我嫁给了他。伊丽莎白非常恼怒，许多英格兰贵族也是。我的同父异母兄弟，马里伯爵，试图想阻止这场婚姻。我不得不和他作战，他逃到了南方，去了英格兰。我很快乐。你的父亲和我每天欢声笑语。他现在是苏格兰亨利亲王了。</p>
<p>After one or two weeks, the laughter stopped. A King has a lot of work, James, you know that. He has to read hundreds of letters, talk to people, and think about a lot of important things. I did those things, every day. But now, I thought, I had a man to help me.</p>
<p>过了两三个星期，笑声不复存在。一个国王有许多工作要做，詹姆斯，你是知道的。他不得不阅读成千上万封书信；和民众交谈；仔细考虑许多重要的事务。我每天做这些事情，不过现在，我想我有个男人来帮我了。</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord Henry, 'I said. &lsquo;Would you like to read all the letters with me? You can sit next to me, and you can work with me every day.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;亨利，我的丈夫，&rdquo;我说。&ldquo;你想和我一起阅读这些书信吗？你可以陪在我身边，每天和我一起工作。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your father looked unhappy. &lsquo;I'm not interested in work like that, ' he said. &lsquo;I don't understand it.'</p>
<p>你父亲看起来不太高兴。&ldquo;我对那样的工作不感兴趣，&rdquo;他说。&ldquo;我不懂那些。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not, 'I said. &lsquo;You're a young man, my love. But I can teach you.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;当然不懂啦，&rdquo;我说。&ldquo;你还年轻，我亲爱的。不过我可以教你。&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one or two days he sat down with me, and I tried to teach him. But it was true, he was not interested in the work, and he did not try to understand it.</p>
<p>他和我一起坐了一两天，我试着去教他。但没错，他确实对这项工作不感兴趣，也不打算去领会。</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do it, Mary, ' he said. &rsquo;I'm going out with my friends. We're going to ride, and drink, and swim.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;你做吧，玛丽，&rdquo;他说。&ldquo;我要和朋友们出去，我们要去骑马、喝酒、游泳。&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I did all the work. At night, too, he often went out with his friends in the town. They drank a lot, and laughed and sang, and there were often fights. But no one said anything, because he was the King, my husband. What could people say? They were unhappy, but they were afraid of him. Some of them went to England, to the Earl of Moray.</p>
<p>因此我又承担起所有的工作。晚上，他也经常和镇上的朋友一起出去。他们喝很多酒，又笑又唱，还经常打架。但没有人说什么，因为他是亲王，我的丈夫。人们能说什么呢？他们很不高兴，但他们怕他。他们有些人去了英格兰，到马里伯爵那里去了。</p>
<p>At this time I was often very tired, because I was pregnant. You, my son James, were alive inside me. But I did all the work of a Queen and I needed friends too. One of these friends was a young Italian, David Riccio.</p>
<p>那段时间我经常感到疲惫不堪。因为我怀孕了。你，我的儿子詹姆斯，在我的体内生存着。可我仍在做一个女王应做的一切工作，因此我也需要朋友。朋友中有一位是个年轻的意大利人，叫达维&bull;里奇奥。</p>
<p>Riccio was a little man and he was not tall or beautiful or strong. But he was a very clever, interesting man. He wrote many of my letters for me, and helped me. He sang well, too, and I sometimes sang with him in the evenings. I liked him very much, and at first, your father liked him too.</p>
<p>里奇奥是个小男人，他不高，不好看也不强壮。但他是个非常聪明、有趣的男人。他替我写了许多信，给我帮助。他歌也唱得好，在晚上，有时我们一起唱歌。我很喜欢他，起初，你的父亲也喜欢他。</p>
<p>But then, Moray's friends began to talk about me and Riccio. &lsquo;David Riccio is in the Queen's rooms every night, 'they said to your father.&lsquo;She laughs and sings and dances with him, my lord&mdash;it is not right! He is not a Scotsman, and he is not her husband. He is always with her.'</p>
<p>不过没多久，马里的朋友们开始谈论我和里奇奥。&ldquo;达维&bull;里奇奥整夜呆在女王的房间里。&rdquo;他们对你的父亲说。&ldquo;她和他唱歌、跳舞，笑声不断，我的亲王&mdash;&mdash;这是不对的！他不是苏格兰人，也不是她的丈夫。可他总是和她在一起。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps they said other things, too&mdash;I don't know. A lot of Scots lords listened to them. But I tell you, James, before God, I did nothing wrong. David Riccio was a good man. He worked hard, and he helped me&mdash;so of course I liked him.Your father did not work&mdash;he went out to the town every night with his friends, and drank.</p>
<p>也许他们还说了些别的事情。&mdash;&mdash;我不知道。很多苏格兰贵族都听到了。不过我告诉你，詹姆斯，在上帝的面前，我没做任何错事。达维&bull;里奇奥是个好人，他工作努力，还帮助我&mdash;&mdash;我当然喜欢他。你的父亲不工作&mdash;&mdash;他每天晚上和他的朋友到镇上去喝酒。</p>
<p>And then one night, your father came home.</p>
<p>此后的一天晚上，你的父亲回家来了。</p>

<p>Chapter 4 The death of David Riccio</p>
<p>It was a Saturday evening in March 1566. I was in Edinburgh with some friends. David Riccio was there, with six or seven other people. We were in a small room, but there was a good dinner on the table, and we were happy. It was dark outside, but inside it was warm and friendly.</p>
<p>1566年 3月的一个星期六晚上。我和一些朋友呆在爱丁堡。达维&bull;里奇奥也在那里，另外还有六、七个人。我们在一间小屋子里，桌上摆着丰盛的菜肴，我们都很高兴。虽然外面夜幕笼罩，但屋子里充满了温暖和友好的气氛。</p>
<p>Suddenly, a door opened behind me. In the door was Henry Darnley, my husband. I stood up and smiled.</p>
<p>突然，我身后的门被打开了，门口站着我的丈夫亨利&bull;达恩利。我站起来朝他笑。</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good evening, my lord,' I said. &lsquo;Please come in. Would you like something to eat?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;晚上好，我的丈夫，&rdquo;我说道，&ldquo;请进来吧，你想吃点什么吗？&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,' he said.&lsquo;I'm not hungry. But I want to sit next to you, wife. Please tell that man to move.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;不，谢谢，&rdquo;他说。&ldquo;我不饿。但我想坐在你身边，我的妻子。请叫那个人走开。&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man got out of the chair next to me and Darnley sat beside me. Then he put his arms round me. I did not like it. His face was hot, and his eyes looked unhappy. But I smiled and said, &lsquo;I'm happy to see you, my lord.'</p>
<p>一人从我身旁的座位上站起来，达恩利坐到了我身边。然后他伸出手环抱着我。我不喜欢这样。他的脸很热，他的眼神看起来很不高兴。但我还是笑着对他说。&ldquo;很高兴见到你，我的丈夫。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you, Mary?' He laughed. &lsquo;Are you really?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;是吗，玛丽？&rdquo;他笑道。&ldquo;是真的吗？&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course, my lord. But&mdash;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，当然是的，我的丈夫。不过&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the second door opened and his friend, Lord Ruthven, stood there. He had a knife in his hand. His face was red, and he looked very angry.</p>
<p>接着，第二扇门打开了，他的朋友&mdash;&mdash;鲁斯温勋爵站在那儿。他手里拿着一把刀。他的脸红红的，满脸怒容。</p>
<p>At first no one moved. Then Ruthven said, &lsquo;Your Majesty, send David Riccio out of this room, now! I want him!'</p>
<p>起初，谁也没有动。然后鲁斯温说道，&ldquo;陛下，把达维&bull;里奇奥从这房间里赶出去，马上！我要他！&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Riccio. He was afraid. &lsquo;Why?' I said. &lsquo;Why do you want him?'</p>
<p>我看着里奇奥，他显得很害怕。&ldquo;为什么？&rdquo;我问，&ldquo;你为什么要他？&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a bad,wicked man!' Ruthven said. &lsquo;Send him out!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;他是个不道德的坏人！&rdquo;鲁斯温说。&ldquo;把他赶出去！&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!' I said. &lsquo;You want to kill him. David Riccio is my friend! He stays here, with me!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;不！&rdquo;我说。&ldquo;你想杀他。达维&bull;里奇奥是我的朋友！他呆在这里，和我在一起！&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He goes out, woman!' Lord Ruthven said. &lsquo;King Henry, hold your wife, please!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;他得出来，女人！&rdquo;鲁斯温勋爵说。&ldquo;亨利亲王，抓住你的妻子，快点！&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood up, but Darnley held my arms and I could not move. David Riccio ran behind me and held my dress. My friends in the room stood up too, and moved towards Ruthven angrily. But he had a knife in his hand.</p>
<p>我站了起来，可是达恩利抓住我的胳膊，我不能动弹。达维&bull;里奇奥跑到我身后抓住我的衣服。我房间里的朋友们也站了起来，愤怒地向鲁斯温逼近，但是鲁斯温手里拿着刀。</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get back!' he said angrily. &lsquo;Don't touch me!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;回去！&rdquo;他怒吼。&ldquo;不要过来！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then five men with knives ran into the little room, and there was a fight. One man held a knife in my face, and another man hit David Riccio, behind me. Then they pulled him out of the room.</p>
<p>接着，五个拿刀的男人冲进了这间小屋。一场冲突开始了。一个男人把刀架在我面前，另一个人去攻击躲在我身后的达维&bull;里奇奥。然后他们把他拖出了房间。</p>
<p>&lsquo;Help me!' he screamed. &lsquo;Help me, my Queen&mdash;please! They're going to kill me! Don't&mdash;aaaaaargh!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;救命！&rdquo;他尖叫道。&ldquo;救救我，我的女王&mdash;&mdash;请救救我！他们要杀我！不要！&mdash;&mdash;啊！&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn't help him, because Darnley had me in his arms. But I could hear David Riccio's screams. I think he fell down the stairs, and he screamed for two or three minutes. Then it was quiet.</p>
<p>我帮不了他，因为达恩利紧紧抓着我。可是我能听到达维&bull;里奇奥的尖叫声。我想他是从楼梯上摔了下去，尖叫持续了二三分钟后。一切归于平静。</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing?' I asked Darnley angrily. &lsquo;Riccio is a good man&mdash;why are you doing this?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;你在干什么？&rdquo;我愤怒地责问达恩利。&ldquo;里奇奥是个好人&mdash;&mdash;你为什么要这样做？&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darnley laughed.&lsquo;You are my wife, Mary&mdash;not David Riccio's!' he said. &lsquo;so why are you with him every evening? You never talk to me!'</p>
<p>达恩利笑道。&ldquo;你是我的妻子，玛丽&mdash;&mdash;不是达维&bull;里奇奥的！&rdquo;他说。&ldquo;所以你为什么要每晚和他呆在一起？你从没对我说过！&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don't talk to you because you are never here!' I said. &lsquo;You are always drinking with your friends! You aren't a king, you're a stupid boy!'</p>
