<p>Alex: Hey, did you see that news about the sexual assault case in India?</p>
<p>Emily: Yeah, it's horrifying. How can such incidents still happen?</p>
<p>Alex: I know, right? It's heartbreaking. But it's good that it's getting national attention. Maybe it'll lead to some positive changes.</p>
<p>Emily: True. But it's frustrating how the legal system sometimes fails to protect victims.</p>
<p>Alex: Absolutely. And the social stigma victims face makes it even harder for them to come forward.</p>
<p>Emily: Do you think this will push for stricter laws and better enforcement?</p>
<p>Alex: Let's hope so. But it's a complex issue. Education and awareness are crucial too.</p>
<p>Emily: Agreed. And it's not just an Indian problem; sexual violence is a global issue.</p>
<p>Alex: Yeah, we need a collective effort to create a safer world for everyone.</p>
<p>Emily: Definitely. Let's stay informed and support initiatives that promote change.</p>
<p>Alex: Agreed. And let's hope justice prevails for the victim in this case.</p>
