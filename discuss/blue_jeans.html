<p>Blue jeans, white shirt</p>
<p>Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn</p>
<p>It was like James Dean for sure</p>
<p>You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer</p>
<p>You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop</p>
<p>But you fit me better than my favorite sweater</p>
<p>And I know that love is mean (oh-oh), and love hurts (oh-oh)</p>
<p>But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby</p>
<p>I will love you 'til the end of time</p>
<p>I would wait a million years</p>
<p>Promise you'll remember that you're mine</p>
<p>Baby, can you see through the tears?</p>
<p>Love you more than those bitches before</p>
<p>Say you'll remember (oh, baby)</p>
<p>Say you'll remember (baby, ooh)</p>
<p>I will love you 'til the end of time</p>
<p>Big dreams, gangsta</p>
<p>Said you had to leave to start your life over</p>
<p>I was like, "No, please, stay here</p>
<p>We don't need no money, we can make it all work"</p>
<p>But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday</p>
<p>I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin'</p>
<p>But he was chasin' (oh-oh) paper (oh-oh)</p>
<p>"Caught up in the game, " that was the last I heard</p>
<p>I will love you 'til the end of time</p>
<p>I would wait a million years</p>
<p>Promise you'll remember that you're mine</p>
<p>Baby, can you see through the tears?</p>
