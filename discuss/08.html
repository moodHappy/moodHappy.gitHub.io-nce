<p>The Coldest Place On Earth</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Two Ships</p>
<p>The race began in the summer of 1910.</p>
<p>比赛开始于1910年夏天。</p>
<p>On June lst, in London, a black ship, the Terra Nova, went down the river Thames to the sea. Thousands of people stood by the river to watch it. They were all excited and happy.</p>
<p>6月1日，伦敦。特若&bull;诺瓦号这艘黑船顺泰晤士河而下，向大海驶去。成千上万的人伫立岸边观望，所有的人脸上都露出兴奋与幸福。</p>
<p>On the Terra Nova, Captain Robert Falcon Scott smiled quietly. It was a very important day for him. He was a strong man, not very tall, in the blue clothes of a captain. He was forty-one years old, but he had a young face, like a boy. His eyes were dark and quiet.</p>
<p>特若&bull;诺瓦号上，队长罗伯特&bull;福尔康&bull;斯科特无声地笑了。这一天对他来说太重要了。他个头不高，但长得壮实，穿着蓝色的队长制服。他虽说已经41岁，但是由于长着一张娃娃脸，所以看上去仍像个小孩。他双眼乌黑而又沉静。</p>
<p>One man on the ship, Titus Oates, smiled at Scott.</p>
<p>泰特斯&bull;奥茨，船上的一位水手，冲着队长笑了。</p>
<p>'What an exciting day, Captain!' he said. 'Look at those people! I feel like an important man!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;多么令人兴奋的日子啊，队长！&rdquo;他说，&ldquo;看看这些人！我觉得自己好似成为重要人物了！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott laughed. 'You are important, Titus, 'he said. 'And you're going to be famous, too. We all are. Do you see this flag？'He looked at the big British flag at the back of the ship, and smiled at Oates. 'That flag is coming with us, 'he said.</p>
<p>队长朗声笑了。&ldquo;泰特斯，你的确是重要人物，&rdquo;他说，&ldquo;而且你很快就要名扬天下，就同我们大家一样。你看到这国旗了吗？&rdquo;他注视着船尾那面巨幅的英国国旗，微笑着对奥茨说：&ldquo;那面国旗将会随我们一道去。</p>
<p>'In the Antarctic, I'm going to carry it under my clothes. We're going to be the first men at the South Pole, and that flag is going to be first, too!'</p>
<p>在南极洲，我将把它夹在衣服里面带着。我们将成为首批到达南极的人，那面国旗也将是第一面到达南极的旗帜。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five days later, on June 6th, a man opened the door of his wooden house in Norway. He was a tall man, with a long face. He waited outside the house for a minute. Everything was very quiet. He could see no houses, only mountains, trees, and water. It was nearly dark. The sky was black over the mountains.</p>
<p>5天以后，6月6日。在挪威，一个人拉开了自己的木房子的门。这人高个、长脸。他在室外稍候片刻，四周万籁俱寂。他目光所及之处，没有住房，只有群山、树林和大海。天近傍晚，群山上面是黑沉沉的一片天空。</p>
<p>The man smiled, and walked quickly away from the house, down to the sea. In the water, a big wooden ship waited for him. The man got onto the ship, and talked and laughed quietly with his friends.</p>
<p>这人脸上露出微笑，快步离开木屋，朝海边走去。大海中，一艘大型木船正等着他。他来到船上，与朋友们聊着，悄悄地笑着。</p>
<p>The ship's name was Fram, and the man was Roald Amundsen. The Fram was the most beautiful ship on earth, Amundsen thought. His friends were the best skiers on earth, too. One of them, Olav Bjaaland, smiled at him.</p>
<p>这船叫弗雷门号，这人便是罗阿尔&bull;阿蒙森。阿蒙森认为，弗雷门号是地球上最美丽的一艘船。他的朋友是地球上最优秀的滑雪者。其中有位朋友叫奥拉夫&bull;比阿兰德，正冲着他微笑。</p>
<p>'North Pole, here we come, Captain, 'he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;北极，我们去那儿，队长。&rdquo;他说。</p>
<p>'Yes.' Amundsen said. His friends could not see his face in the dark. 'Fram is going to the Arctic.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，&rdquo;阿蒙森说。由于天色已黑，这位朋友看不见他的面部表情。&ldquo;弗雷门号正驶向北极。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone on the Fram was ready to go to the North Pole, to the Arctic. Amundsen wanted to go there, too. But first he wanted to go south. His friends didn't know that.</p>
<p>弗雷门号上的每个人全都准备就绪：到北极圈，上北极。阿蒙森也想去那儿。然而他第一想做的事，便是向南航行。他的朋友却毫不知情。</p>
<p>At midnight on June 6th, the Fram moved quietly away from Amundsen's house, out to sea.</p>
<p>6月6日午夜，弗雷门号无声地驶离阿蒙森的家园，驶向大海。</p>

<p>Chapter 2 The race</p>
<p>The Fram went to an island in the south of Norway. It was a very little island, with only one small wooden house, two trees&mdash;and nearly a hundred dogs.</p>
<p>弗雷门号抵达挪威南部的一个小岛。该岛很小，仅有一间小木屋，两棵树，还有将近100条狗。</p>
<p>'Look at that!' Bjaaland said. 'It's an island of dogs! There are dogs in the water, near the trees, on the house&mdash;dogs everywhere!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;看那儿！&rdquo;比阿兰德说，&ldquo;是座狗岛！海水里有狗，树旁有狗，房顶上有狗，处处都有狗！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men came out of the house. 'Hassel! Lindstrom!' Amundsen said. 'It's good to see you! How many dogs do you have for me?'</p>
<p>房内走出两个人。&ldquo;哈塞尔！林德斯特伦！&rdquo;阿蒙森呼唤说，&ldquo;见到你们就好了！你们给我养了多少条狗？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Ninety-nine, Roald, 'said Hassel. 'The best ninety-nine dogs from Greenland. And they're very happy! They don't work; they just eat and play all day! They're having a wonderful summer here!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;99条，罗阿尔，&rdquo;哈塞尔说，&ldquo;99条格陵兰最好的狗。这些狗太好过了，啥事不干，整天好吃好玩！它们正在这儿欢度夏天呢！&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Good, good. 'Amundsen laughed. 'But that's finished now. Hey, Bjaaland! Stop laughing&mdash;come down here and help me. Let's get all these dogs onto the ship!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;好，好，&rdquo;阿蒙森朗声笑了，&ldquo;但是现在这一切全结束了。喂，比阿兰德！别笑啦，下船来这儿，帮帮我，把这些狗全弄到船上去！&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not easy. The dogs were fat and strong, and they didn't want to go on the ship. But at last, after three hours' hard work, all ninety-nine were on the ship, and the Fram went out to sea again.</p>
<p>这事并不容易。这些狗又肥又壮，不愿上船。然而在苦干3小时后，所有99条狗全都上船，弗雷门号再度驶向大海。</p>
<p>The men were not happy. The weather was bad, the dogs were dirty, and some of the men were ill. They began to ask questions.</p>
<p>船上的人员高兴不起来：气候恶劣，狗群肮脏，而且有人病倒了。于是，他们便开始提出种种问题。</p>
<p>'Why are we bringing dogs witn us?' asked one man, Jo-hansen. 'We're going thousands of kilometres south, past Cape Horn, and then north to Alaska. Why not wait, and get dogs in Alaska?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;我们为什么要带这些狗？&rdquo;有人提问说，他叫约翰森。&ldquo;我们即将南行好几千公里，穿越合恩角，然后向北，到阿拉斯加。为什么不等等，等到阿拉斯加后再弄狗？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Don't ask me, 'said his friend, Helmer Hanssen, 'I don't understand it.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;别问我，&rdquo;他的朋友赫尔默&bull;汉森说，&ldquo;我也搞不懂。&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men talked for a long time. Then, on September 9th, Amundsen called everyone to the back of the ship. He stood quietly and looked at them. Behind him was a big map. It was not a map of the Arctic. It was a map of Antarctica.</p>
<p>好长时间内，这些人一直都在议论纷纷。后来，9月9日那天，阿蒙森将所有人员召集到大船尾部。他静静地站着，看着众人。他身后有一大幅地图，然而这不是北极地图，而是南极洲地图。</p>
<p>Bjaaland looked at Helmer Hanssen, and laughed. Then Amundsen began to speak.</p>
<p>比阿兰德看着赫尔默&bull;汉森，笑出声来。这时，阿蒙森开始讲话。</p>
<p>'Boys, 'he said. 'I know you are unhappy. You often ask me difficult questions, and I don't answer. Well, I'm going to answer all those questions now, today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;伙计们，&rdquo;他说，&ldquo;我知道你们心中不满。你们经常问我一些难题，我都没有回答。好吧，今天我当即解答所有的问题。&rdquo;</p>
<p>We began to work for this journey two years ago. Then, we wanted to be the first men at the North Pole. But last year, Peary, an American, found the North Pole. So America was first to the North Pole, not Norway. We're going there, but we're too late.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;两年前，我们便开始为这次旅程做准备。当时，我们想成为最先抵达北极的人。然而去年，美国人皮里找到了北极。所以，美国人首先到达了北极，而不是挪威人。我们现在正要去那儿，但为时过晚了。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'I don't understand this,' Bjaaland thought. 'Why is Amundsen talking about the North Pole, with a map of Antarctica behind him?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;我听不懂这些话，&rdquo;比阿兰德心想，&ldquo;阿蒙森身后挂着南极洲地图，为什么却大谈北极呢？&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amundsen stopped for a minute, and looked at all the men slowly. No one said anything.</p>
<p>阿蒙森稍作停顿，缓缓地看着全体人员。这时没有任何人多嘴。</p>
<p>'We have to go a long way south before we get to Alaska, 'he said. 'Very near Antarctica, you know. And Captain Scott, the Englishman, is going to the South Pole this year. He wants to put his British flag there. An American flag at the North Pole, a British flag at the South Pole.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;到阿拉斯加前，还得南行好远的路，&rdquo;他说。&ldquo;你们都知道，几乎是到了南极洲。英国人斯科特队长今年正赶往南极。他想将英国国旗插在那儿。美国国旗已经插上了北极，而英国国旗正插向南极。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bjaaland began to understand. He started to smile and couldn't stop. He was warm and excited.</p>
<p>比阿兰德开始省悟了，脸上露出了微笑，难以自制。他浑身暖洋洋的，亢奋不已。</p>
<p>'Well, boys, 'Amundsen said slowly. 'Do we want the British to put their flag at the South Pole first? How fast can we travel? We have a lot of dogs, and some of the most wonderful skiers on earth&mdash;Bjaaland here is the best in Norway! So I have an idea, boys. Let's go to the South Pole, and put the Norwegian flag there before the British! What do you say?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;好吧，伙计们，&rdquo;阿蒙森缓缓地说，&ldquo;眼睁睁地看着英国人将他们的旗帜首先插上南极，我们能同意吗？我们的前行速度非常之快，不是吗？我们不仅带着许多狗，而且拥有地球上最杰出的滑雪能手：我们这儿的比阿兰德便是全挪威最优秀的！所以，我有个主意，伙计们。咱们到南极去，赶在英国国旗之前，将挪威国旗插到那儿去！你们有何看法？&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute or two it was very quiet. Amundsen waited, and the men watched him and thought. Then Bjaaland laughed.</p>
<p>一时间，整个场面安静极了。阿蒙森等待着，而这些人看着他，考虑着这些。这时，比阿兰德朗笑出声。</p>
<p>'Yes!' he said. 'Why not? It's a ski race, isn't it, and the English can't ski! It's a wonderful idea, of course! Let's go!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;对！&rdquo;他说，&ldquo;为什么不呢？这是场滑雪比赛，难道不是吗？再说，英国人不会滑雪！这主意绝妙之极！咱们就去那儿！&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chapter 3 The Ponies</p>
<p>On October 27th, the Terra Nova arrived in Wellington, New Zealand. When Scott came off the ship, a newspaper man walked up to him.</p>
<p>10月27日，特若&bull;诺瓦号船抵达新西兰的惠灵顿。当斯科特走下船时，一位报社记者迎面走来。</p>
<p>'Captain Scott! Captain Scott! Can I talk to you, please!' he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;斯科特队长！斯科特队长！我能与你谈谈吗？&rdquo;他说。</p>
<p>Scott stopped and smiled. 'Yes, of course, 'he said. 'What do you want to know?'</p>
<p>斯科特停下来，面带微笑。&ldquo;行，当然可以！&rdquo;他说，&ldquo;你想知道什么？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Are you going to win?' the man asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;你们会是赢家吗？&rdquo;那人问。</p>
<p>'Win?' Scott asked. 'Win what?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;赢家？&rdquo;斯科特问，&ldquo;什么赢家？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Win the race to the South Pole, of course, 'the newspaper man said. 'It's a race between you and Amundsen, now. Look at this!' He gave a newspaper to Scott. Scott looked at it. It said: Scott's face went white. 'Give me that!' he said. He took the newspaper and read it carefully. The newspaper man watched him, and waited. 'Well, Captain Scott, 'he said at last. 'Who's going to win this race? Tell me that!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;当然是赢得前往南极的竞赛。&rdquo;报社记者说。&ldquo;现在这个竞赛在你与阿蒙森之间展开。瞧！&rdquo;他将一份报纸递给斯科特。斯科特看着报纸。报上是这样写的：弗雷门号正与斯科特争先到达南极。阿蒙森说：&ldquo;我们将赢得比赛！&rdquo;斯科特脸色变得苍白。&ldquo;给我报纸！&rdquo;他说。他拿过报纸认真阅读。记者观察着他，期待着。&ldquo;那么，斯科特队长，&rdquo;他最终开口了，&ldquo;谁将赢得这场比赛？请告诉我！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott looked at him angrily. 'This is stupid!' he said. 'It's not a race! I came here to learn about the Antarctic&mdash;I'm not interested in Amundsen, or in races!' Then he walked back onto his ship, with the newspaper in his hand.</p>
<p>斯科特愤怒地看着他。&ldquo;真是愚蠢！&rdquo;他说，&ldquo;这不是比赛！我来这儿是为了了解南极。我对阿蒙森对比赛都不感兴趣！&rdquo;然后，他回到船上，手里拿着那张报纸。</p>
<p>Later that day, he talked to his men. He gave them the newspaper, and laughed.</p>
<p>当天晚些时候，他对同行人员讲起这事，将报纸递给他们，并且大笑起来。</p>
<p>'It doesn't matter, 'he said. 'We're in front of Amundsen, and we have more men, and more money. He has only eight men, and a lot of dogs. I know about dogs&mdash;they don't work in the Antarctic. We have sixteen men and the new motor sledges&mdash;they are much better. And tomorrow the ponies are coming. We need ponies, motor sledges, and good strong British men&mdash;that's all. Forget about Amundsen! He's not important!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;没关系，&rdquo;他说，&ldquo;我们现今还在阿蒙森前面。我们不仅人数占优势，而且钱也更多。他呢，除了许多狗外，只有8个人。我熟悉狗性：它们在南极洲干不了活儿。我们有16个人，还配有新式机动雪橇。这些雪橇比狗好使多了。明天，还有小马送来。我们需要小马、机动雪橇以及身强力壮的英国人！这些就够了。忘了那个阿蒙森！他并不重要！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott asked Oates to look after the ponies, but he did not let Oates buy them. When Oates first saw the ponies, in New Zealand, he was very unhappy. Most of the ponies were old, and some of them were ill.</p>
<p>斯科特分配奥茨喂养小马，但不让他负责买马。在新西兰，奥茨一见到这些小马，便大为光火。这些小马大部分都已老态毕呈，有些还是病马。</p>
<p>'They're beautiful ponies, Titus, 'Scott said. 'They come from China&mdash;they're wonderful ponies!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;这些都是漂亮的小马，泰特斯，&rdquo;斯科特说，&ldquo;纯中国货，匹匹都极为出色！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oates looked at them angrily, and said nothing. Then he asked：'Where is their food, Captain?'</p>
<p>奥茨恼火地看着这些小马，没有说什么。随即他问：&ldquo;队长，它们的饲料在哪里？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Here!' Scott opened a door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;这儿！&rdquo;斯科特打开一道门。</p>
<p>Oates looked inside. He thought for a minute. 'We need more food than this, Captain Scott! These ponies are going to work in the coldest place on earth&mdash;they need a lot of food&mdash;more than this!'</p>
<p>奥茨朝里看了看，思索了一会儿。&ldquo;我们需要更多饲料，斯科特队长！这些小马将在地球上最冷的地区干活儿：它们需要许多饲料，远不止这些！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott smiled quietly. 'We can't take more food on this ship, Titus. Where can we put it? But it doesn't matter, old boy. They're very strong ponies, you know. The best ponies on earth.'</p>
<p>斯科特无声地笑了。&ldquo;这条船上，我们不可能带许多饲料，泰特斯。往哪放呢？没什么关系，老兄。你看见了，这些马十分壮实，是地球上最好的小马。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later that night, Oates wrote a letter to his mother. There are nineteen ponies on the Terra Nova now, he wrote. All the penies are in a small room at the front of the ship. We eat our food in the room under the ponies, so our table is often wet and dirty. Scott makes a lot of mistakes, I think, and Antarctica is a very dangerous place.</p>
<p>那天深夜，奥茨给他母亲写了封信。信是这样写的：特若&bull;诺瓦号船上现在有 19匹小马，所有小马都养在船首的小舱里。我们进餐的地方正好位于装运小马的船舱下面。所以我们的餐桌经常湿漉漉、脏兮兮的。我认为，斯科特犯了许多错误。南极洲其实是非常危险的地方。&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chapter 4 Food Depots</p>
<p>The two ships, Terra Nova and fram, arrived in Antarctica, in January 1911, at the end of summer. The Englishmen and the Norwegians wanted to stay on the ice all winter. They wanted to be ready to go to the South Pole at the beginning of the next Antarctic summer.</p>
<p>艘船，特若&bull;诺瓦号与弗雷门号都抵达南极洲，时间为1911年1月，夏末。英国人与挪威人均想在这冰封的天地里度过整个冬天。他们都想做好准备工作，以求这儿第二年夏天刚开始时能向南极进军。</p>
<p>The dogs pulled the Norwegians' sledges. They ran quickly over the snow and pulled the big sledges from the ship onto the ice. The men ran beside them on skis.</p>
<p>群狗拉着挪威人的雪橇，在雪地上高速奔跑，将从船上卸下来的大雪橇拉到了冰封世界。众人踩着滑雪板滑行在一旁。</p>
<p>They put a big wooden house on the ice. The house was full of food, and skis, and sledges. They called it Framheim. Outside the house, the dogs lived in holes under the snow. When the house was ready, the men made their first journey south.</p>
<p>他们在冰封世界上建起一座大木屋。屋子里堆满了食品、滑雪板以及雪橇。他们将这木屋称作弗雷门海姆。木屋外，群狗住在雪下挖出的狗洞里。当木屋准备就绪时，他们开始了首次南行征途。</p>
<p>Before the winter, they wanted to take a lot of food south, and leave it in depots. For the long journey to the Pole, they needed a lot of food, and they couldn't carry it all with them. On February 10th, five men, three sledges, eighteen dogs, and half a tonne of food left Framheim and went south.</p>
<p>在冬天来临之前，他们打算向南方运出许多食物，并将食物放到各个贮藏屋里。因为在奔赴南极的漫长旅程中，他们需要许多食物。他们不可能随身带着所有的食物！2月10日，5个人、3辆雪橇、18条狗、以及半吨食物离开了弗雷门海姆，向南而去。</p>
<p>It was easy. The weather was warm for the Antarctic, between -7&deg;Centigrade and&mdash;17&deg;Centigrade. The snow was good, and the dogs and skis went fast. They went fifty or sixty kilometres every day. After four days they reached 80&deg;South, and made the first depot.</p>
<p>事情进行得颇为顺利。此时的南极气候相对来说还算暖和，介于－7℃与－17℃之间。雪地质量不错，狗与雪橇都跑得不慢，每天能走五六十公里。4天之后，他们到达南纬80&deg;的地方，建立了第一个贮藏屋。</p>
<p>Amundsen made his depot very carefully. It was very important to find it again, next summer. So he put a big black flag on top. Then he put ten flags to the east of the depot&mdash;each flag half a kilometre from the next&mdash;and ten flags to the west. So there were flags for five kilometres to the left of the depot, and five kilometres to the right.</p>
<p>阿蒙森非常精心地修建他的贮藏屋。明年夏天需要再度找到它，这点特别重要。所以，他在贮藏屋顶上插上一面黑旗。随后他在贮藏屋的东边插上10面旗帜：每半公里插一面；在贮藏屋西边也插上10面旗帜。所以，从贮藏屋向左延伸5公里，见得着旗帜；向右延伸5公里，也看得见旗帜。</p>
<p>Then they went back to Framheim, and took some more food south, this time to 82&deg;South.</p>
<p>随后，他们返回弗雷门海姆，带上更多的食品后，再度南行。这次抵达了南纬82&deg;的地方。</p>
<p>This time it was harder. The temperature was sometimes -40&deg;Centigrade, and there were strong winds with a lot of snow. The dogs and men were very tired, and the tents and boots were bad. At the second depot, they put out sixty flags, to help them find it again.</p>
<p>这次旅程辛苦多了。温度有时低达－40℃。寒风凛冽，雪花漫天。人困狗乏，帐篷与靴子也不顶事了。在第二个贮藏屋附近，他们插了60面旗，目的是帮助他们能再次找到它。</p>
<p>They came back to Framheim on March 23rd. It was nearly winter in the Antarctic. Their ship Fram was far away now, near South America. They were alone on the ice.</p>
<p>他们再度回到弗雷门海姆时，已是3月23日。这时南极时近冬天。他们的弗雷门号船早已远驶而去，现在到了南美洲附近。只有他们孤独地留在冰封的天地里。</p>
<p>Oates went with Scott to make the first British depot. They left Cape Evans on January 25th. There were thirteen men, eight ponies, and twenty-six dogs. The dogs were faster than the ponies&mdash;they ran quickly over the top of the snow, but the ponies' feet went through it. Every morning the ponies started first, and the dogs started two hours later, because they ran faster. At night, the dogs made warm holes under the snow, but the ponies stood on top of the snow. It was -20&deg;Centigrade.</p>
<p>奥茨跟随斯科特，前往修建第一座英国人的贮藏屋。他们于1月25日离开了开普埃文斯。一行13人、8匹小马、26条狗。这些狗比小马要快：它们能够在雪地上快速地奔跑，但是马腿却要陷进雪里。每天早晨，都是小马首先出发。2小时后，狗儿们才上路，因为它们奔跑速度快些。夜里，狗躲进挖在雪下面的温暖的洞里，但是小马只能站在雪地上，承受着－20℃的气温。&nbsp;</p>
<p>After fifteen days Oates talked to Scott. There was a strong wind, and the two men's faces were white with snow.</p>
<p>15天后，奥茨向斯科特请示。当时强劲的寒风刮起，两人脸上都沾上一层白雪。</p>
<p>'Three of these ponies are ill, Captain, 'Oates said. 'They can't go on.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;队长，有3匹小马病了，&rdquo;奥茨说，&ldquo;走不动了。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Don't be stupid, Oates, 'Scott answered. 'They're good strong animals&mdash;the best ponies on earth.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;别犯傻了，奥茨，&rdquo;斯科特回答说，&ldquo;它们都是强壮的好畜牲，地球上最好的小马。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Not these three, 'Oates said. 'They're ill, and unhappy, and now they can't walk. Let's kill them, and leave the meat here, in the snow. We can eat it, or the dogs can.'</p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->&ldquo;这3匹不是，&rdquo;奥茨说，&ldquo;它们病歪歪的，无精打采。现在它们根本无法走路。杀了它们吧，将肉留在这儿的雪里。要么我们吃，要么让狗吃。&rdquo;<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
