<p>The Monkey's Paw</p>
<p>Chapter 1&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was cold and dark out in the road and the rain did not stop for a minute. But in the little living-room of number 12 Castle Road it was nice and warm. Old Mr White and his son, Herbert, played chess and Mrs White sat and watched them. The old woman was happy because her husband and her son were good friends and they liked to be together. &rsquo;Herbert's a good son,&rsquo; she thought.&rsquo; We waited a long time for him and I was nearly forty when he was born, but we are a happy family.&rsquo; And old Mrs White smiled.</p>
<p>外面的马路上又冷又黑，雨一直下个不停。但城堡路12号的一间小客厅里却满暖和。老怀特先生和他的儿子赫伯特在下象棋，怀特太太坐在一旁看着他们。老妇人因她的丈夫和儿子是好朋友并乐于在一起而高兴。&ldquo;赫伯特是一个好孩子，我们等了很长时间才要到的孩子，他出生的时俟我都快四十岁了，但我们的家庭很幸福。&rdquo;老怀特太太想着、想着，脸上露出了笑容。</p>
<p>It was true. Herbert was young and he laughed a lot, but his mother and his father laughed with him. They had not got much money, but they were a very happy little family.</p>
<p>这是事实，赫伯特年轻又爱笑，他的母亲和父亲也总跟着乐。他们并没有很多钱，但他们有一个幸福的小家庭。</p>
<p>The two men did not talk because they played carefully. The room was quiet, but the noise of the rain was worse now and they could hear it on the windows. Suddenly Old Mr White looked up. 'Listen to the rain!' he said.</p>
<p>两个男人无言地下着棋。房间里很安静，但雨声现在更大了，他们能听到雨点打在窗上的声音。突然，老怀特先生抬起头说，&ldquo;听听雨声！&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Yes, it's a bad night,&rsquo; Herbert answered.&rsquo; It's not a good night to be out. But is your friend, Tom Morris, coming tonight?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，这是一个糟糕的夜晚，&rdquo;赫伯特答道，&ldquo;这样的夜晚不宜外出，但你的朋友汤姆&bull;莫里斯今晚不是要来吗？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Yes, that's right. He's coming at about seven o'clock,&rsquo; the old man said.&rsquo; But perhaps this rain&hellip;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，你说得对。他将在7点钟左右到，但也许这雨&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;老汉说。</p>
<p>Mr White did not finish because just then the young man heard a noise.</p>
<p>怀特先生没有说下去，因为就在这时，年轻人听到了一种声音。</p>
<p>'Listen!' Herbert said.&rsquo; There's someone at the door now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;听！&rdquo;赫伯特说，&ldquo;现在门外有人。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'I didn't hear a noise,&rsquo; his father answered, but he got up from his chair and went to open the front door. Mrs White got up too and began to put things away.</p>
<p>他的父亲答道，&ldquo;我没有听到声音。&rdquo;但他还是从椅子上起来去开门，怀特太太也站起来开始收拾东西。</p>
<p>Mr White said,&rsquo; Come in, come in, Tom. It's wonderful to see you again. What a bad night! Give me your coat and then come into the living-room. It's nice and warm in there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>怀特先生说，&ldquo;汤姆，快请进，快请进。又见到你真高兴。多么糟糕的夜晚！把外套给我，到客厅里去，那儿暖和。&rdquo;</p>
<p>The front door was open, and in the living-room Mrs White and Herbert felt the cold. Then Mr White came back into the living-room with a big, red-faced man.</p>
<p>前门打开了，客厅里的怀特太太和赫伯特感觉到一阵寒气。怀特先生领着一位高大的红脸汉子回到了起居室。</p>
<p>'This is Tom Morris,&rsquo; Mr White told his wife and son.&rsquo; We were friends when we were young. We worked together before Tom went to India. Tom, this is my wife and this is our son, Herbert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;这是汤姆&bull;莫里斯，&rdquo;怀特先生告诉他的太太和儿子，&ldquo;我们年轻的时候是好朋友，在汤姆去印度之前我们在一起工作过。汤姆，这是我太太，这是我儿子，赫伯特。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Pleased to meet you,&rsquo; Tom Morris said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;很高兴见到你们，&rdquo;汤姆&bull;莫里斯说。</p>
<p>'Pleased to meet you, Mr Morris,&rsquo; Mrs White answered.&rsquo; Please come and sit down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;我们也很高兴见到你，莫里斯先生。&rdquo;怀特太太答道，&ldquo;请过来坐下吧。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Yes, come on, Tom,&rsquo; Mr White said.&rsquo; Over here. It's nice and warm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;对，过来，汤姆，到这儿来，这儿舒服暖和一点。&rdquo;怀特先生说。</p>
<p>'Thank you,&rsquo; the big man answered and he sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;谢谢你。&rdquo;高大的汉子答应着坐下了。</p>
<p>'Let's have some whisky,&rsquo; Old Mr White said.&rsquo; You need something to warm you on a cold night.&rsquo; He got out a bottle of whisky and the two old friends began to drink and talk. The little family listened with interest to this visitor from far away and he told them many strange stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;我们喝一点威士忌吧，&rdquo;老怀特先生说，&ldquo;这样寒冷的夜晚，你需要一点东西暖和暖和身子。&rdquo;他拿出一瓶威士忌，两位老朋友边喝边谈。这个小家庭饶有兴趣地倾听着这位来自远方的造访者告诉他们许多离奇的故事。&nbsp;</p>

<p>After some time Tom Morris stopped talking and Mr White said to his wife and son,&rsquo; Tom was a soldier in India for twenty-one years. India is a wonderful country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>不知过了多长时间，汤姆&bull;莫里斯停止了交谈。怀特先生告诉他太太和儿子，&ldquo;汤姆到印度服兵役有21年了。印度是一个非常有趣的国家。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Yes,&rsquo; Herbert said.&rsquo; I'd like to go there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，&rdquo;赫伯特说，&ldquo;我喜欢去那儿。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Oh, Herbert!' his mother cried. She was afraid because she did not want to lose her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;不，赫伯特！&rdquo;他母亲惊叫起来。她非常害怕，因为她不想失去儿子。</p>
<p>'I wanted to go to India too,&rsquo; her husband said,&rsquo; but&hellip;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;我也想去印度，&rdquo;她的丈夫说，&ldquo;不过&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>'It's better for you here!' the soldier said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;对你来说，这儿很不错！&rdquo;老兵很快地说。</p>
<p>'But you saw a lot of strange and wonderful things in India. I want to see them too one day,&rsquo; Mr White said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;你在印度看到了那么多奇怪又有趣的东西，我想有一天也能去看看。&rdquo;怀特先生说。</p>
<p>The soldier put down his whisky.&rsquo; No!' he cried.&rsquo; Stay here !'</p>
<p>老兵放下威士忌。&ldquo;不！&rdquo;他嚷道，&ldquo;别说了！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mr White did not stop.&rsquo; But your stories were interesting,&rsquo; he said to Tom Morris.&rsquo; What did you begin to say about a monkey's paw?'</p>
<p>老怀特先生并没有停下，&ldquo;你的故事很有趣，&rdquo;他对汤姆&bull;莫里斯说，&ldquo;关于猴爪的事你想告诉我们什么？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Nothing!' Morris answered quickly.&rsquo; Well&hellip;nothing important.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;没什么！&rdquo;莫里斯很快地回答，&rdquo;真的，无关紧要。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'A monkey's paw?' Mrs White said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;猴爪？&rdquo;怀特太太惊问。</p>
<p>'Come on, Mr Morris! Tell us about it,&rsquo; Herbert said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;继续给我们讲讲吧，莫里斯先生。&rdquo;赫伯特说。</p>
<p>Morris took his whisky in his hand, but suddenly he put it down again. Slowly he put his hand into the pocket of his coat and the White family watched him.</p>
<p>莫里斯用手拿起他的威士忌，但突然又把它放下，然后慢慢地把手伸进他的外套口袋。怀特一家看着他。</p>
<p>'What is it? What is it?' Mrs White cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;那是什么东西？那是什么东西？&rdquo;怀特太太叫道。</p>
<p>Morris said nothing. He took his hand out of his pocket. The White family watched carefully&mdash;and in the soldier's hand they saw something little and dirty.</p>
<p>莫里斯什么也没说，他把手拿出口袋。怀特一家仔细地看着&mdash;&mdash;在老兵手里他们看到了一个又小又脏的东西。</p>
<p>Mrs White moved back, afraid, but her son, Herbert, took it and looked at it carefully.</p>
<p>怀特太太害怕地缩了回来，但她的儿子赫伯特却把那东西拿过来仔细地看。</p>
<p>'Well, what is it?' Mr White asked his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;喂，那是什么？&rdquo;怀特先生问他的朋友。</p>
<p>'Look at it,&rsquo; the soldier answered.&rsquo; It's a little paw&hellip;a monkey's paw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;看看吧，&rdquo;老兵答道，&ldquo;它是一只小爪子啊&hellip;&hellip;一只猴子的爪子。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'A monkey's paw!' Herbert said&mdash;and he laughed.&rsquo; Why do you carry a monkey's paw in your pocket, Mr Morris?' he asked the old soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;猴子的爪子！&rdquo;赫伯特说着大笑起来。&ldquo;为什么你在口袋里带着猴爪，莫里斯先生？&rdquo;他问老兵。</p>
<p>'Well, you see,&rsquo; Morris said,&rsquo; this monkey's paw is magic!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;你要明白，这个猴爪是有魔力的！&rdquo;莫里斯说。</p>
<p>Herbert laughed again, but the soldier said,&rsquo; Don't laugh, boy. Remember, you're young. I'm old now and in India I saw many strange things.&rsquo; He stopped talking for a minute and then he said,&rsquo; This monkey's paw can do strange and wonderful things. An old Indian gave the paw to one of my friends. My friend was a soldier too. This paw is magic because it can give three wishes to three people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>赫伯特又笑了，但老兵认真地说，&ldquo;孩子，别笑了，记住，你还年轻，可我现在老啦，我曾在印度见到了很多奇怪的事情。&rdquo;他停了一会儿，接着说，&ldquo;这个猴爪能做奇怪而又奇妙的事情，一个印度老人把这个猴爪给了我的一位朋友，我的朋友也是一个当兵的。这猴爪有魔力是因为它能满足三个人每人提出的三个愿望。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Wonderful!' Herbert said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;太妙了！&rdquo;赫伯特说。</p>
<p>'But these three wishes don't bring happiness,&rsquo; the soldier said.&rsquo; The old Indian wanted to teach us something&mdash;it's never good to want to change things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;但这三个愿望并不能带来幸福。&rdquo;老兵提醒说，&ldquo;印度老人想告诉我们&mdash;&mdash;想改变现实并不一定是好事。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Well, did your friend have three wishes?' Herbert asked the old soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;那么，你的朋友也有三个愿望吗？&rdquo;赫伯特问老兵。</p>
<p>'Yes,&rsquo; Morris answered quietly.&rsquo; And his third and last wish was to die!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，&rdquo;莫里斯静静地回答，&ldquo;并且他的第三个也是最后一个愿望就是去死！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs White listened to the story and they felt afraid, but Herbert asked,&rsquo; And did he die?'</p>
<p>怀特先生和怀特太太听了这个故事感到有些害怕，赫伯特问，&ldquo;他死了吗？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Yes, he did,&rsquo; Morris said.&rsquo; He had no family, so his things came to me when he died. The monkey's paw was with his things, but he told me about it before he died,&rsquo; Tom Morris finished quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，他死了，&rdquo;莫里斯说，&ldquo;他没有家，所以他死的时候把他的东西全给了我，猴爪是这些东西的附带品，不过他死之前就告诉过我有关猴爪的故事。&rdquo;汤姆&bull;莫里斯静静地说。</p>
<p>'What were his first two wishes, then?' Herbert asked. 'What did he ask for?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;那么，他的头两个愿望是什么？&rdquo;赫伯特追问，&ldquo;他要求什么？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'I don't know. He didn't want to tell me,&rsquo; the soldier answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;我不知道，他不想告诉我。&rdquo;老兵回答说。</p>
<p>For a minute or two everybody was quiet, but then Herbert said,&rsquo; And you, Mr Morris: did you have three wishes?'</p>
<p>一两分钟里大家都沉默着，然而赫伯特又问，&ldquo;莫里斯先生，你有三个愿望吗？&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Yes, I did,&rsquo; Morris answered.&rsquo; I was young. I wanted many things&mdash;a fast car, money&hellip; 'Morris stopped for a minute and then he said with difficulty,&rsquo; My wife and my young son died in an accident in the car. Without them I didn't want the money, so, in the end, I wished to lose it. But it was too late. My wife and my child were dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;是的，我有过，&rdquo;莫里斯问答说，&ldquo;我年轻时，我想要很多东西&mdash;&mdash;一辆跑车，还有钱&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;莫里斯顿了一会儿，然后很艰难地说，&ldquo;我的妻子和我年轻的儿子在一次事故中丧生，没有了他们我不再想要钱，以至到最后，我希望一无所有，但为时已晚，我的妻子和孩子并不能死而复生。&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was very quiet. The White family looked at the unhappy face of the old soldier.</p>
<p>房子里很静，怀特一家看着老兵苦楚的脸。</p>
<p>Then Mr White said,&rsquo; Why do you want the paw now? You don't need it. You can give it to someone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>接着，怀特先生问，&ldquo;为什么你现在还要这个爪子呢？你不需要它，你可以把它送给别人。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'How can I give it to someone?' the soldier said.&rsquo; The monkey's paw brings unhappiness with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;我怎么能送给别人呢？&rdquo;老兵说，&ldquo;猴爪会给拥有它的人带来痛苦。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Well, give it to me,&rsquo; Mr White said.&rsquo; Perhaps this time it&hellip;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;那么，给我吧，&rdquo;怀特先生说，&ldquo;也许这次它&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>'No!' Tom Morris cried.&rsquo; You're my friend. I can't give it to you.&rsquo; then, after a minute, he said,&rsquo; I can't give it to you, but, of course you can take it from me. But remember&mdash;this monkey's paw brings unhappiness!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;不！&rdquo;汤姆&bull;莫里斯叫道，&ldquo;你是我的朋友，我不能把它给你。&rdquo;过了一会儿，他说，&ldquo;我不能把它给你，但你可以从我身边把它拿走，不过要记住&mdash;&mdash;猴爪会给你带来痛苦！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mr White did not listen and he did not think. Quickly, he put out his hand, and he took the paw.</p>
<p>老怀特没有听进去也没有仔细想，很快地伸出手拿走了猴爪。</p>
<p>Tom Morris looked unhappy, but Mr White did not want to wait.</p>
<p>汤姆&bull;莫里斯看起来不高兴，但怀特先生等不及了。</p>
<p>'What do I do now?' he asked his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;我现在能做什么？&rdquo;他问他的朋友。</p>
<p>'Yes, come on, Father, Herbert said.&rsquo; Make a wish!' And he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;对，这样吧，父亲，&rdquo;赫伯特说，&ldquo;许个愿吧！&rdquo;赫伯特笑了。</p>
<p>The soldier said nothing and Mr White asked him again,&rsquo; What do I do now?'</p>
<p>老兵什么也不说，怀特先生又问他，&ldquo;我现在能做些什么呢？&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the old soldier did not answer, but in the end he said quietly,&rsquo; OK. But remember! Be careful! Think before you make your wish,&rsquo;</p>
<p>开始，老兵什么也不回答，最后他静静地说，&ldquo;好吧，但记住要小心，在你许愿之前要考虑好。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'Yes, yes,&rsquo; Mr White said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;行，行。&rdquo;怀特先生说。</p>
<p>'Take the paw in your right hand and then make your wish, but&hellip;'tom Morris began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;把猴爪拿在你右手，然后许愿，但是&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;汤姆&bull;莫里斯又开始了他那一套。</p>
<p>'Yes, we know,&rsquo; Herbert said.&rsquo; Be careful!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;行了，我们知道。&rdquo;赫伯特说，&ldquo;要小心！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then old Mrs White stood up and she began to get the dinner. Her husband looked at her. Then he smiled and said to her,&rsquo; Come on. Help me !What can I wish for? We need money, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>这时怀特太太站起来去做晚饭。她的丈夫看着她，并笑着对她说，&ldquo;过来帮帮我，我能许一个什么愿呢？当然，我们需要钱。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs White laughed, but she thought for a minute and then she said, &lsquo;Well, I'm getting old now and sometimes it's difficult to do everything. Perhaps I need four hands and not two. Yes, ask the paw to give me two more hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>怀特太太笑了起来，她想了一会儿说，&ldquo;是的，我开始变老啦，有时做事情很吃力。可能我需要四只手而不是两只手，那么好吧，让猴爪多给我两只手。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'OK, then,&rsquo; her husband said, and he took the monkey's paw in his right hand. Everybody watched him and for a minute he waited. Then he opened his mouth to make his wish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;好吧，&rdquo;她的丈夫说，他把猴爪放在右手。每个人都看着他，他等了一会儿然后张开嘴开始许愿。</p>
<p>Suddenly Tom Morris stood up.&rsquo; Don't do it!' he cried.</p>
<p>突然，汤姆&bull;莫里斯站起来。&ldquo;不要这样！&rdquo;他喊道。</p>
<p>The old soldier's face was white. Herbert and his mother laughed, but Mr White looked at Tom's face.</p>
<p>老兵的脸变白了。赫伯特和他的母亲笑了起来，但怀特先生却看着汤姆的脸。</p>
<p>Old Mr White was afraid and he put the monkey's paw into his pocket.</p>
<p>老怀特先生害怕了，他把猴爪放进了口袋。</p>
<p>After a minute or two they sat down at the table and began to have dinner. The soldier told the family many strange and wonderful stories about India. They forgot the monkey's paw, and because the soldier's stories were interesting, they asked him many questions about India. When Tom Morris stood up to leave, it was very late.</p>
<p>一两分钟后，他们坐在桌旁开始吃晚饭。老兵告诉这一家许多有关印度的新奇的故事。他们暂时忘了猴爪，因为老兵的故事很有趣，他们问了许多有关印度的问题。当汤姆&bull;莫里斯起来要走时，天色已经很晚了。</p>
<p>'Thank you for a very nice evening,&rsquo; Morris said to the family.&rsquo; And thank you for a very good dinner, 'he said to Mrs White.</p>
<p>&ldquo;感谢有这么一个美好的夜晚，&rdquo;莫里斯对这一家人道谢，&ldquo;感谢有这样一顿美好的晚餐，&rdquo;他对怀特太太说。</p>
<p>'It was a wonderful evening for us, Tom,&rsquo; Old Mr White answered.&rsquo; Your stories were very interesting. Our life isn't very exciting and we don't have the money to visit India, so please come again soon. You can tell us some more stories about India.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;汤姆，对我们来说这也是一个美好的夜晚，&rdquo;老怀特先生回答道，&ldquo;你的故事很有趣。我们的生活很平淡，我们没有钱去印度，所以请你尽快再来，你可以告诉我们更多关于印度的故事。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old soldier put on his coat. He said goodbye to the White family, and went out into the rain.</p>

<p>Old Mr White sat in the cold living-room for a long time. The candle died and it was dark Suddenly, the old man saw a face at the window. Quickly, he looked again, but there was nothing there. He felt afraid. Slowly he stood up and left the cold, dark room.</p>

<p>The next morning the winter sun came through the window and the house felt nice and warm again. Mr White felt better and he smiled at his wife and son. The family sat down to have breakfast and they began to talk about the day. The monkey's paw was on a little table near the window, but nobody looked at it and nobody thought about it.</p>
<p>第二天早晨，冬日的阳光穿过窗户，房子里重新变得温暖。怀特先生感觉很好，他对着妻子和儿子微笑。一家子坐下来共进早餐，他们讨论着白天要干的事。猴爪放在窗子边的小桌上，但没有人去看它，也没有人想到它。</p>
<p>'I'm going to the shops this morning, ' Mrs White said. 'I want to get something nice for dinner. Are you going to come with me?' she asked her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;上午我想去商店，&rdquo;怀特太太说，&ldquo;我想买一点好东西做晚餐，你愿意和我一块去吗？&rdquo;她问丈夫。</p>

<p>'And we aren't going to have stories about monkey's paws!' Mrs White said. She was angry. 'Why did we listen to your friend?' she asked her husband.' A monkey's paw can't give you things!' she stopped but the two men did not answer her. 'Thirty thousand pounds!' she said quietly. 'We needed that money.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;我们再也不相信有关猴爪的故事！&rdquo;怀特太太说。她发火了。&ldquo;为什么我们要相信你的朋友？&rdquo;她问丈夫，&ldquo;一个猴爪不会给你任何东西的！&rdquo;她停了下来，但两个男人并没有回答她。&ldquo;30 000英磅！&rdquo;她平静地说，&ldquo;我们需要那些钱。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Herbert looked at the clock and stood up. 'I'm going to work, ' he said. 'Perhaps the postman has got the money for you in a letter. Remember, I want some of it too!' Herbert laughed and his mother laughed too.</p>
<p>就在这时，赫伯特看看时间并站了起来。&ldquo;我要去工作了，&rdquo;他说，&ldquo;也许邮差在一封信里把钱寄给你，记住，我也想要一些！&rdquo;赫伯特笑了，她母亲也笑了。</p>
<p>'Don't laugh, son, ' Mr White said. 'Tom Morris is an old friend and he thinks the story is true. Perhaps it is.'</p>

<p>'Nothing, 'his wife answered, and she sat down to finish her breakfast. She began to think about Tom Morris again and suddenly she said to her husband, 'Your friend drank a lot of whisky last night! A monkey's paw! What a story!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;没事儿，&rdquo;妻子说着就坐下来继续吃她的早餐。她又开始想汤姆&bull;莫里斯的事。突然，她对丈夫说，&ldquo;昨天晚上你的朋友喝了太多的威士忌！讲了神奇的猴爪！可怕的故事！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr White did not answer her because just then the post man arrived. He brought two letters for them&mdash;but there was no money in them. After breakfast the two old people forgot about the money and the monkey's paw.</p>
<p>怀特先生没有回答她，因为这时候邮差到了，邮差为他们带来了两封信，但里面并没有钱。早餐后，两位老人已忘记了钱和猴爪的事。</p>
<p>Later in the day, at about one o'clock, Mr and Mrs White sat down to eat and then they began to talk about money again. They did not have very much money, so they often needed to talk about it.</p>
<p>这一天晚些时候，大约1点左右，怀特夫妇坐下来吃东西；又开始了有关钱的谈论，他们没有富足的钱，所以他们常常需要谈论钱。</p>

<p>Then he said, 'But that thing moved. The monkey's paw moved in my hand! Tom's story was true!'接着，他说，&ldquo;但那东西确实移动了。猴爪在我的手里动了！汤姆的故事是真的！&rdquo;</p>
<p>'You drank a lot of whisky last night. Perhaps the paw didn't move, 'Mrs White answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;你昨晚喝多了。也许猴爪并未移动。&rdquo;怀特太太回答道。</p>
<p>'It moved!' Mr White cried angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;坐下来，吃完你的饭！&rdquo;怀特先生说。</p>
<p>The old woman did not listen to her husband.&rsquo; He isn't going away, ' she went on.&rsquo; He's coming back. I don't know him - he's a stranger. Yes, he's very well-dressed&hellip;'suddenly Mrs White stopped. She was very excited.&rsquo; He's coming to the door&hellip; Perhaps he's bringing the money!'</p>
<p>老妇人并没有听丈夫的话。&ldquo;他没走，&rdquo;她继续说，&ldquo;他又回来了，我不认识他，他是陌生人。不错，他穿得很讲究&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;突然，怀特太太不说话了，她很兴奋，&ldquo;他正朝我们的门口走来&hellip;&hellip;也许他给我们带来了钱！&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she ran out of the room to open the front door.</p>
<p>她跑出房间，打开了前门。</p>
<p>The tall, well-dressed stranger stood there. For a minute he said nothing, but then he began, 'Good afternoon. I'm looking for Mr and Mrs White.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;哦，我就是怀特太太，&rdquo;老妇人答道，&ldquo;我能为你做些什么吗？&rdquo;</p>

<p>陌生人顿了顿才说，&ldquo;怀特太太，我从莫和麦金森来，我能进去跟您谈谈吗？&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs White looked at the stranger and she thought, 'Perhaps he has the money&hellip; but why Maw and Meggins? And his face is very unhappy&hellip; Why?' suddenly the old woman was afraid.</p>
<p>怀特太太看着陌生人，想道，&ldquo;也许，他很有钱&hellip;&hellip;但为什么来自莫和麦金森？从他的脸色看他并不高兴&hellip;&hellip;为什么？&rdquo;突然，老妇人很害怕。</p>
<p>'Please sit down, ' Mr White began, but now his wife could not wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;请坐。&rdquo;怀特先生说，但她妻子已经等得不耐烦了。</p>
<p>'What's the matter?' she cried.&rsquo; Is Herbert&hellip;'she could not finish the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;出了什么事？&rdquo;她叫了起来，&ldquo;是不是赫伯特&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;她几乎不能把话问完。</p>
<p>The stranger did not look at their faces&mdash;and Mr White began to be afraid too.</p>
<p>陌生人并不瞧他们的脸，怀特先生也开始害怕了。</p>
<p>'Please, tell us!' he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;请告诉我们！&rdquo;他说。</p>

<p>从莫和麦金森来的人停了好一会儿才开始说，&ldquo;对不起，非常对不起，今天早晨，工厂发生了一起事故&hellip;&hellip;。&rdquo;</p>
<p>'What's the matter? Is Herbert OK?' Mrs White cried again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;到底出了什么事，赫伯特还好吗？&rdquo;怀特太太又叫了起来。</p>
<p>'Well&hellip;' the man began slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;是这样&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;陌生人慢慢地说。</p>
<p>'Is he in hospital? the old woman asked, very afraid now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;他住院了吗？&rdquo;老妇人问，现在她非常害怕。</p>
<p>'Yes, but&hellip;' the stranger looked at Mrs White's face and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;但是&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;陌生人看了一眼怀特太太的脸又停了下来。</p>
<p>'Is he dead? Is Herbert dead? Mr White asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;他死了吗？赫伯特死啦？&rdquo;怀特先生平静地问。</p>
<p>'Dead!' Mrs White cried.&rsquo; Oh no&hellip; please&hellip;not dead! Not Herbert! Not our son!'</p>
<p>&ldquo;死啦，&rdquo;怀特太太哭叫着。&ldquo;不，请不要这样说&hellip;&hellip;，不，赫伯特不会死，我们的儿子不会死！&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the old woman stopped because she saw the stranger's face. Then the two old people knew. Their son was dead! Old Mrs White began to cry quietly and Mr White put his arm round her.</p>
<p>突然，老妇人不喊了，因为她看见了陌生人的表情。两个老人明白，他们的儿子已经死了！老怀特太太呜咽着，怀特先生伤心地搂着她。</p>
<p>Some time later the man from Maw and Meggins said, 'It was the machinery&mdash;an accident Herbert called, &lsquo;Help!&rsquo;. The men heard him&mdash;and ran to him quickly, but they could do nothing. The next minute he was in the machinery. I'm very, very sorry, ' he finished.</p>
<p>过了一会儿，从莫和麦金森来的男人说，&ldquo;那是一起机器事故，听到赫伯特喊救命，工友们跑过去，可一点办法也没有。只能眼睁睁地看着赫伯特在机器里。对不起，非常对不起。&rdquo;他结束一了讲话。</p>
<p>For a minute or two the room was quiet. At last Mrs White said, 'Our son! Dead! We're never going to see him again. What are we going to do without him?'</p>
<p>刹那间，屋子里非常安静。最后，怀特太太说，&ldquo;我们的儿子，死了，我们再也不能见到他了，没有他，我们以后的日子怎么过？&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband said, 'He was our son. We loved him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>他丈夫说，&ldquo;他是我们的儿子，我们爱他。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mrs White asked the stranger, 'Can we see him? Can we see our son? Please take me to him. I want to see my son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>接着，怀特太太问陌生人，&ldquo;我们能看看他吗？我们能不能看看我们的儿子？请带我去，我想去看看我的儿子。&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the stranger answered quickly, 'No!' he said.&rsquo; It's better not to see him. They couldn't stop the machinery quickly. He was in there for a long time. And at first they couldn't get him out. He was&hellip;' the man stopped. Then he said ,'Don't go to see him!'</p>
<p>但陌生人很快答道，&ldquo;不行，最好不要去看他，他们不能快速把机器停下来，赫伯特在里面呆了很长时间，并且开始的时候弄不出来，他&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;陌生人停了下来，接着他说，&ldquo;还是别去看他吧！&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger went over to the window because he did not want to see the faces of the two old people. He said nothing, but he stood there for some time and he waited.</p>
<p>陌生人走到窗户边，因为他不想看到两位老人的痛苦的表情，他什么也没说，站在那儿等了好长时间。</p>
<p>Then he went back to the old people and began to talk again. 'There's one more thing, ' he said. 'Your son worked for Maw and Meggins for six years and he was a good worker. Now Maw and Meggins want to help you at this unhappy time.&rsquo; Again the stranger stopped. After a minute he began again.&rsquo; Maw and Meggins want to give you some money.&rsquo; Then he put something into Mr White's hand.</p>
<p>然而，他又回过身来开始和两位老人谈话。&ldquo;但是，你们的儿子是一个好工人，他为莫和麦金森工作了6年。现在，莫和麦金森要在这个不幸的时候帮助你们。&rdquo;陌生人又停了下来，过了一会儿又说，&ldquo;莫和麦金森想给你们一些钱。&rdquo;说完，他把一些东西交到怀特先生手上。</p>
<p>Old Mr White did not look at the money in his hand. Slowly he stood up and looked at the stranger, afraid.&rsquo; How much?' Mr White asked, very quietly. He did not want to hear the answer.</p>
<p>老怀特先生没有看手里的钱，他慢慢地站起来，害怕地看着陌生人，&ldquo;多少钱？&rdquo;怀特先生非常平静地问。其实他并不想听到答案。</p>
<p>'Thirty thousand pounds,' the stranger said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;30 000英镑。&rdquo;陌生人说。&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chapter 6</p>
<p>Three days later, in the big, new cemetery two miles from their house, the two old people said goodbye to their dead son. Then they went back to their dark, old house. They did not want to live without Herbert, but they waited for something good to happen, something to help them. The days went by very slowly. Sometimes they did not talk because there was nothing to say without Herbert. And so the days felt very long.</p>
<p>三天后，在离他们家两英里远的一个大而新的墓地，两位老人和他们死去的儿子道别了。然后，他们回到了又黑又旧的房子。没有了赫伯特，他们什么也不想做，他们等待着奇迹发生。时间过得很慢，有时他们连话也不想说，因为没有了赫伯特，就无话可说了。所以他们觉得白天很长。</p>
<p>Then, one night, about a week later, Mrs White got out of bed because she could not sleep. She sat by the window and she watched and waited for her son. He did not come and she began to cry quietly.</p>
<p>一周后的一天晚上，怀特太太因失眠从床上爬了起来。她坐在窗户边看着，等着她的儿子回来。想到赫伯特也回不来了，她又低声地哭了起来。</p>

<p>&ldquo;我儿子那儿更冷，&rdquo;他妻子回应他，&ldquo;他一个人呆在外面冰冷的墓地里。&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs White did not go back to bed, but Mr White was old and tired and the bed was warm. So, in the end, he went to sleep again. Suddenly he heard a cry from his wife.</p>
<p>怀特太太没有回去睡觉，但怀特先生因又老又累，加上温暖的被窝，很快又睡着了。突然他听见了妻子的叫声。</p>

<p>&ldquo;爪子！&rdquo;她喊道，&ldquo;猴爪！&rdquo;她走到床边站在那儿。</p>

<p>客厅里很黑，怀特先生又没有蜡烛。他慢慢地穿过房间，伸手摸着找猴爪。他摸到了但又很快把手缩了回去。</p>

<p>But they did not sleep. They waited and they listened. In the end Mr White got up to get a candle because the dark made him more afraid. He began to go downstairs, but suddenly he heard a noise at the front door. He stopped, and he listened. He could not move. Then the noise came again. This time he ran.
