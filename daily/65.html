Lesson: 65: Birthday present

<p>Angela, come in.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday!</p>
<p>Thanks. I can&rsquo;t believe you remembered that.</p>
<p>Well, I have a calendar on my computer. It helps me remember things like that. What are you up to?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading a book my cousin gave me for my birthday.</p>
<p>Let me see. Oh, I have this book at home. I want to give you a present too.</p>
<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s a guitar. I already have one, but I like this one better. Thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome. Do you know how to play the guitar?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know how to play. My father taught me when I was young.</p>
<p>Will you play it now? I want to listen to some music.</p>
<p>Do you know this one?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard that one. I could sing that song when I was in middle school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an old one. It makes me feel old. When I was in college they use to play it on the radio all the time.&nbsp;</p>
