Lesson 85: Snowing outside

<p>Hey, what have you been doing today?</p>
<p>Nothing, just watching TV. I&rsquo;m really bored. I don&rsquo;t have anything to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything to do either. I didn&rsquo;t do anything today except clean my house.</p>
<p>I know. I was planning to go to the mall today with one of my friends, but it snowed so much we couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>I hope it snows all night because I don&rsquo;t want to go to school tomorrow.</p>
<p>Do you know anyone who has a camera? I want to take a picture of all this snow.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know anyone who has a camera.</p>
<p>Have you seen Sara today? I think she might have one.</p>
<p>No, she hasn&rsquo;t been around all day. She said she had something important to do today?</p>
<p>Oh, where did she go?</p>
<p>Nobody knows. I called her roommate and she doesn&rsquo;t know either.</p>
