Lesson 35: At the Restaurant
<p>This looks like a nice restaurant.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is. I come here all the time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s sit over there.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Can you pass me a menu please.</p>
<p>Sure. What are you going to have to drink?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have a glass of beer. How about you?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll have a glass of wine.</p>
<p>Do you want to order an appetizer first?</p>
<p>Not really, maybe we can just order some bread.</p>
<p>What are you going to have to eat?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. I haven&rsquo;t decided yet. Can you recommend something?</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;ve had the steak and the lobster before. They&rsquo;re both very good.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll have the lobster. What are you going to have?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that hungry. I think I&rsquo;m just going to have a salad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to the bathroom. When the waitress comes back, will you order for me?</p>
<p>Sure. No problem.</p>
