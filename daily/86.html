Lesson 86: Missed call


<p>Mandy, did you know Heather called you?</p>
<p>No. When did she call?</p>
<p>Two hours ago, I think.</p>
<p>Two hours ago? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me earlier?</p>
<p>Sorry, I forgot.</p>
<p>What did she say?</p>
<p>She said she was waiting for you at her sister&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>OK, I was going to cook dinner first, but I don&rsquo;t think I have enough time now. I&rsquo;ll just warm up some leftovers in the microwave.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>If she calls again, tell her I&rsquo;m gonna be late.</p>
<p>OK, no problem.</p>
<p>This is very important. Don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>Actually, would you please hand me my phone? I think I should give her a call now. She&rsquo;s probably wondering where I am.</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;ll get it for you.</p>
