Lesson 6: Do you want something to drink?
<p>David, would you like something to eat?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m full.</p>
<p>Do you want something to drink?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;d like some coffee.</p>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t have any coffee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s OK. I&rsquo;ll have a glass of water.</p>
<p>A small glass, or a big one?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small, please.</p>
<p>Here you go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.&nbsp;</p>
