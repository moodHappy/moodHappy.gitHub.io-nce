Lesson 46: Leaving a Message
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hi, is Heather there, please?</p>
<p>Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.</p>
<p>Is this 617-228-2289?</p>
<p>Yes. Who are you looking for again?</p>
<p>Heather Johnson.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you said Laura. Sorry about that. This is the right number, but Heather&rsquo;s not here right now.</p>
<p>Do you know where she went?</p>
<p>She went to the store to buy some groceries. Would you like to leave a message?</p>
<p>Yes, would you please tell her Eric Martin called?</p>
<p>Hi Eric, this is her roommate Kathy. I met you a couple of months ago at the Christmas party.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. How are you?</p>
<p>Good. Heather will be back in about 20 minutes. I&rsquo;ll tell her you called.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Bye bye.&nbsp;</p>
