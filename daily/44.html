Lesson 44: Looking at Vacation Pictures
<p>Jim, I heard you took a trip to San Diego. Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I just got back this morning.</p>
<p>That sounds really nice. What did you do there?</p>
<p>Well, we were only there for three days, so we didn&rsquo;t do too much. We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times. At night we walked around the city with some friends.</p>
<p>Did you take any pictures?</p>
<p>Yes, I have them with me. Do you want to look at them?</p>
<p>Sure, I love looking at photos.</p>
<p>This one is of my wife and me on the beach, and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife.</p>
<p>Your daughter looks like her mother.</p>
<p>I know, they look very similar.</p>
<p>Where was this picture taken?</p>
<p>That was taken at the train station before we left.</p>
<p>Did you have time to go to the zoo?</p>
<p>No, not this time. We went there last time.</p>
<p>It looks like you all had a nice time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a lot of fun.</p>
