Lesson 93: Did you see the news today


<p>John, did you see the news today?</p>
<p>No, what happened?</p>
<p>There was a big earthquake in San Diego.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>The president was on the news talking about it earlier.</p>
<p>Was anyone hurt?</p>
<p>I think they said two people were killed.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t believe you hadn&rsquo;t heard about it. They were talking about it on CNN all day.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t watch TV that often.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you watch the news?</p>
<p>No, I usually read the news online, but I haven&rsquo;t had time to turn on my computer today.</p>
