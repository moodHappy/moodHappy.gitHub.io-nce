Lesson 31: Can you help me find a new thing?
<p>I can&rsquo;t find my glasses &amp; I can&rsquo;t see anything. Can you help me find a few things?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No problem. What are you looking for?</p>
<p>My laptop, do you see it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, your laptop is on the chair.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my book?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>The dictionary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s under the table.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my pencil?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pencil in front of the lamp.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a pencil. That&rsquo;s a pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, sorry. There is a pencil behind the cup.</p>
<p>How about my backpack? Do you know where that is?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in between the wall and the bed.</p>
<p>Where are my shoes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on the left side of the TV.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I made a mistake. They&rsquo;re on the right side of the TV.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and here are your glasses. They were next to your cell phone.</p>
