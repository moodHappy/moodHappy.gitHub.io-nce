Lesson 45: Ordering Flowers
<p>Good afternoon, how may I help you?</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;d like to order some flowers.</p>
<p>Who are they for?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re for my Wife. Her name is Samantha.</p>
<p>What kind of flowers would you like?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know too much about flowers. Can you recommend something?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the reason you are sending her flowers?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers.</p>
<p>Do you know what kind of flowers she likes?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. I know I should know that, but I can&rsquo;t remember right now.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re for your wife, so I think you should give her roses.</p>
<p>Roses will be fine.</p>
<p>What color?</p>
<p>I think red would be nice.</p>
<p>Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them?</p>
<p>Can you deliver them please?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the address?</p>
<p>241 Main street.</p>
<p>Alright, they&rsquo;ll be there within 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>
