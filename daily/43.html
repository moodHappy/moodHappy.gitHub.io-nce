Lesson 43: Visiting Family
<p>Judy, your husband has a really nice car.</p>
<p>Thanks. It&rsquo;s a lot better than mine, and it&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to visit my sister in the city.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know your sister lives in the city, when did she move there?</p>
<p>About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, across from the public library.</p>
<p>I see. It&rsquo;s almost 5:00 PM now, don&rsquo;t you think there will be a lot of traffic?</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re not driving. We&rsquo;re going to take the subway. The subway only takes about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Yes, but it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.</p>
<p>I take the subway to work every day, so I&rsquo;m used to it now.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t your mother live in the city?</p>
<p>Yes, she&rsquo;s lived there for about ten years.</p>
<p>I remember when she moved there. Apartments were a lot cheaper then.</p>
<p>I know what you mean. It&rsquo;s hard to find anything that&rsquo;s reasonable now.</p>
<p>Have a good time. Next time you&rsquo;re free, give me a call and we&rsquo;ll go play poker.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
