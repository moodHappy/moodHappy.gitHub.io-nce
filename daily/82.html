Lesson 82: Worried about dad

<p>Hi Peter, can I talk to you for a moment? I just heard the cookie factory downtown is going out of business.</p>
<p>Where did you hear that?</p>
<p>Sara told me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true. I haven&rsquo;t heard anything about it.</p>
<p>She said that they have already started to lay people off.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t your father work there?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m really worried he might get laid off, he just started to work there about three months ago. What do you think I should do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d talk to your father.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if there was something wrong I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d tell me. He doesn&rsquo;t like to upset me, but I really would like to know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you good friends with the president of that company?</p>
<p>Yes, we use to work together at a different company about five years ago.</p>
<p>Maybe you could call him and see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know. I guess I could. It&rsquo;s pretty late now, but I&rsquo;ll call him in the morning.</p>
<p>OK, thanks so much.</p>
