Lesson 59: Going to the gym

<p>Ed, what should we do today?</p>
<p>I have been studying all week. I&rsquo;d like to exercise.</p>
<p>Me too. Let&rsquo;s go to the gym.</p>
<p>Good idea. What are we going to do there?</p>
<p>We can lift weights or play basketball.</p>
<p>I like to play basketball. Are you good at it?</p>
<p>Not really, but I like to play. I use to play a lot when I was in school, but now there&rsquo;s no time.</p>
<p>I know what you mean. I used to play soccer a lot. Do you think we can play soccer there?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s not enough room. I think it&rsquo;s better if we play outside.</p>
<p>OK, maybe we can go play soccer later this afternoon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too cold outside today. Let&rsquo;s wait until the weather gets a little warmer.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
