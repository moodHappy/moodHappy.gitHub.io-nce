Lesson 98: Gifts


<p>Dorothy, what are your plans for Christmas?</p>
<p>Oh yes, it&rsquo;s almost Christmas, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;ll be doing then.</p>
<p>Well, if you don&rsquo;t have any plans, your family could have dinner at my house.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very nice of you, thanks. Have you finished your shopping yet?</p>
<p>No, I still have to do that. I think I&rsquo;ll go to the mall this weekend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be really crowded at the mall. You should shop online.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. My family loves to read, so I can probably get them all presents from Amazon.com.</p>
<p>What do you think you&rsquo;ll get for your wife?</p>
<p>Probably a romance novel. It seems like she&rsquo;s always reading one of those.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think you should get her something a little more expensive, like jewelry or maybe a new computer?</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s hard buying gifts. I think my wife has everything she wants. Maybe I should just ask her.</p>
