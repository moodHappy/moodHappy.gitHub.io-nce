Lesson 81: A romantic story

<p>Lesson 81: A ROMANTIC STORY</p>
<p>Betty, are you and John still dating?</p>
<p>Yeah, things are going really good.</p>
<p>Where did you meet him?</p>
<p>I met him at the library a couple of weeks ago. We were sitting at the same table and he asked to borrow my pen.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a nice story.</p>
<p>I was telling Jim about it the other day. He thought it was pretty romantic.</p>
<p>Do you two have plans for tonight?</p>
<p>Yes, I think we&rsquo;re going to rent a movie. Have you seen anything good lately?</p>
<p>I saw Spider-Man the other day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that&rsquo;s a really funny movie.</p>
<p>Are you kidding? That movie&rsquo;s not funny. It&rsquo;s sad. I was crying at the end.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really sensitive, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I guess so. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t find a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Lesson 82: WORRIED ABOUT DAD</p>
<p>Hi Peter, can I talk to you for a moment? I just heard the cookie factory downtown is going out of business.</p>
<p>Where did you hear that?</p>
<p>Sara told me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true. I haven&rsquo;t heard anything about it.</p>
<p>She said that they have already started to lay people off.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t your father work there?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m really worried he might get laid off, he just started to work there about three months ago. What do you think I should do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d talk to your father.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if there was something wrong I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d tell me. He doesn&rsquo;t like to upset me, but I really would like to know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you good friends with the president of that company?</p>
<p>Yes, we use to work together at a different company about five years ago.</p>
<p>Maybe you could call him and see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know. I guess I could. It&rsquo;s pretty late now, but I&rsquo;ll call him in the morning.</p>
<p>OK, thanks so much.</p>
<p>Lesson 83: I&rsquo;M GETTING FAT</p>
<p>Wow, I&rsquo;m really getting fat.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t look fat.</p>
<p>Yes, but I am. I&rsquo;ve gained 10 pounds in the last two months. Look at my stomach.</p>
<p>How much do you weigh?</p>
<p>I think about 170 pounds.</p>
<p>What kind of foods do you eat?</p>
<p>I usually have pasta for dinner. Sometimes I get take-out or fast food if I don&rsquo;t have enough time to cook.</p>
<p>I was reading a diet book the other day. It said that if you eat meat and nothing else, you&rsquo;ll lose weight quickly.</p>
<p>Wow, does that work?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but someone told me they tried it and lost 20 pounds.</p>
<p>That sounds good, but I&rsquo;m not sure how long I could do that.</p>
<p>I know, once you start eating vegetables and bread again you&rsquo;ll probably start gaining weight.</p>
<p>Well, I think I&rsquo;m going to try it anyway. Who&rsquo;s the author?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember. It&rsquo;s not that popular anymore. When I get home I&rsquo;ll check and give you a call.</p>
<p>Lesson 84: I&rsquo;LL TAKE YOU TO WORK</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hi Sarah, it&rsquo;s James.</p>
<p>Hey James, I can&rsquo;t talk now. Can I call you back later?</p>
<p>Sure. Is there a problem?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m late for work and my car isn&rsquo;t working, so I need to find someone to take me to work.</p>
<p>I can take you.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Thank you. That would help a lot.</p>
<p>Do you need me to pick you up after work also?</p>
<p>Yes, if it&rsquo;s not too much trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no problem. I&rsquo;m leaving my house now. I&rsquo;ll be right there.</p>
<p>OK. I&rsquo;ll wait for you in front of my apartment building.</p>
<p>Do you know what&rsquo;s wrong with your car?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure. I think there&rsquo;s a problem with the engine.</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll have a look when I get there. I know a lot about cars. When I was younger my father and I use to fix old cars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lesson 85: SNOWING OUTSIDE</p>
<p>Hey, what have you been doing today?</p>
<p>Nothing, just watching TV. I&rsquo;m really bored. I don&rsquo;t have anything to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything to do either. I didn&rsquo;t do anything today except clean my house.</p>
<p>I know. I was planning to go to the mall today with one of my friends, but it snowed so much we couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>I hope it snows all night because I don&rsquo;t want to go to school tomorrow.</p>
<p>Do you know anyone who has a camera? I want to take a picture of all this snow.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know anyone who has a camera.</p>
<p>Have you seen Sara today? I think she might have one.</p>
<p>No, she hasn&rsquo;t been around all day. She said she had something important to do today?</p>
<p>Oh, where did she go?</p>
<p>Nobody knows. I called her roommate and she doesn&rsquo;t know either.</p>
<p>Lesson 86: MISSED CALL</p>
<p>Mandy, did you know Heather called you?</p>
<p>No. When did she call?</p>
<p>Two hours ago, I think.</p>
<p>Two hours ago? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me earlier?</p>
<p>Sorry, I forgot.</p>
<p>What did she say?</p>
<p>She said she was waiting for you at her sister&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>OK, I was going to cook dinner first, but I don&rsquo;t think I have enough time now. I&rsquo;ll just warm up some leftovers in the microwave.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>If she calls again, tell her I&rsquo;m gonna be late.</p>
<p>OK, no problem.</p>
<p>This is very important. Don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>Actually, would you please hand me my phone? I think I should give her a call now. She&rsquo;s probably wondering where I am.</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;ll get it for you.</p>
<p>Lesson 87: SHOPPING FOR A FRIEND</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going shopping. Do you want to come?</p>
<p>I thought you went shopping yesterday.</p>
<p>I did, but an old friend called me last night and invited me to his birthday party. I need to buy a gift for him.</p>
<p>I see. What are you going to get him?</p>
<p>I really have no idea what he likes. I haven&rsquo;t seen him in a long time. What do you think?</p>
<p>Maybe a cake?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good idea, but I think I should probably get him something else, like something he can wear.</p>
<p>How about a sweater? I saw a really nice one in the mall the other day. Maybe we can go there and take a look.</p>
<p>OK, what store was it in?</p>
<p>It was at Macy&rsquo;s. I think they&rsquo;re having a sale this weekend.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a really nice store. I like the clothes there.</p>
<p>Lesson 88: WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR?</p>
<p>Hey Diane, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Hi, Tim, how are you? I&rsquo;m waiting for a friend.</p>
<p>I heard you&rsquo;re going to graduate this summer. Is that true?</p>
<p>Yes. If everything goes alright, I&rsquo;ll be getting my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in August. Then I need to start looking for a job.</p>
<p>I had to do that last year. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. Do you have any job offers?</p>
<p>No, not yet. I sent out a lot of resumes, but I didn&rsquo;t receive many responses. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to find a job right now.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your major?</p>
<p>Psychology.</p>
<p>That was my major when I started college, but I switched to engineering after the first year.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier for engineers to find a job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about that. It took me about 3 months to find a job. I finally was able to get a job after I put my resume on one of those job websites.</p>
<p>Anyway, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. If I can&rsquo;t find a job I&rsquo;ll probably go back to school to get my Masters degree.</p>
<p>Lesson 89: NEW APARTMENT</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hey Gary. What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked to you in a long time, what&rsquo;s been happening?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if you heard, but I just moved into a new apartment in LA.</p>
<p>No, I heard you were thinking about moving but I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d already found a place. That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m really happy about it.</p>
<p>Do you have any roommates?</p>
<p>No, not this time. It&rsquo;s a big change for me &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve never lived alone.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ll be lonely?</p>
<p>Not really, I have two friends who live in the same building. We all had dinner together last night.</p>
<p>Are they students also?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not students, but there are a lot of students living in the building.</p>
<p>Sounds like a nice place.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a good environment for learning English.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear everything worked out.</p>
<p>You should come out here and visit me sometime. There&rsquo;s even a pool.</p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->That would be nice. I&rsquo;ll think about it.<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>

<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->How about that girl from work you were telling me about last year?<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->Who, Emily? She&rsquo;s married now. She got married last month.<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>

<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->Yeah, it&rsquo;s not easy.<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>

<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->There is one girl I like who lives in my building. I talk to her a lot because she&rsquo;s also studying English.<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->What&rsquo;s she like?<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->She&rsquo;s really nice. She moved here from Texas about 3 months ago.<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
<p><!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-start-en-->What does she do?<!--eusoft-did-keyword-comment-end-en--></p>
