Lesson 81: A romantic story

<p>Betty, are you and John still dating?</p>
<p>Yeah, things are going really good.</p>
<p>Where did you meet him?</p>
<p>I met him at the library a couple of weeks ago. We were sitting at the same table and he asked to borrow my pen.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a nice story.</p>
<p>I was telling Jim about it the other day. He thought it was pretty romantic.</p>
<p>Do you two have plans for tonight?</p>
<p>Yes, I think we&rsquo;re going to rent a movie. Have you seen anything good lately?</p>
<p>I saw Spider-Man the other day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that&rsquo;s a really funny movie.</p>
<p>Are you kidding? That movie&rsquo;s not funny. It&rsquo;s sad. I was crying at the end.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really sensitive, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I guess so. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t find a girlfriend.</p>
