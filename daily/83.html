Lesson 83: I’m getting fat

<p>Wow, I&rsquo;m really getting fat.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t look fat.</p>
<p>Yes, but I am. I&rsquo;ve gained 10 pounds in the last two months. Look at my stomach.</p>
<p>How much do you weigh?</p>
<p>I think about 170 pounds.</p>
<p>What kind of foods do you eat?</p>
<p>I usually have pasta for dinner. Sometimes I get take-out or fast food if I don&rsquo;t have enough time to cook.</p>
<p>I was reading a diet book the other day. It said that if you eat meat and nothing else, you&rsquo;ll lose weight quickly.</p>
<p>Wow, does that work?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but someone told me they tried it and lost 20 pounds.</p>
<p>That sounds good, but I&rsquo;m not sure how long I could do that.</p>
<p>I know, once you start eating vegetables and bread again you&rsquo;ll probably start gaining weight.</p>
<p>Well, I think I&rsquo;m going to try it anyway. Who&rsquo;s the author?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember. It&rsquo;s not that popular anymore. When I get home I&rsquo;ll check and give you a call.</p>
