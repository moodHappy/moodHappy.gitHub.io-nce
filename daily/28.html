Lesson 28: What kind of Music do you like
<p>Paul, what kind of music do you like to listen to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>All kinds, but mostly Pop, rock and classical. Why?</p>
<p>I have tickets to a show. Do you want to go with me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of music is it?</p>
<p>Pop. It&rsquo;s Mariah Carey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When is it?</p>
<p>At 8PM tomorrow night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to go. Do you think we should have dinner first?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a good idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment.</p>
<p>Oh, I think I know the place you mean. We ate there last month, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right. You have a good memory.</p>
