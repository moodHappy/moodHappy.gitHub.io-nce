Lesson 89: New apartment

<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hey Gary. What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked to you in a long time, what&rsquo;s been happening?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if you heard, but I just moved into a new apartment in LA.</p>
<p>No, I heard you were thinking about moving but I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d already found a place. That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m really happy about it.</p>
<p>Do you have any roommates?</p>
<p>No, not this time. It&rsquo;s a big change for me &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve never lived alone.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ll be lonely?</p>
<p>Not really, I have two friends who live in the same building. We all had dinner together last night.</p>
<p>Are they students also?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not students, but there are a lot of students living in the building.</p>
<p>Sounds like a nice place.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a good environment for learning English.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear everything worked out.</p>
<p>You should come out here and visit me sometime. There&rsquo;s even a pool.</p>
