<p>Chris, where are you going?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to the store. I need to buy something.</p>
<p>Really? I need to go to the store too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you like to come with me?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you like to go now or later?</p>
<p>Now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Now would be better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Should we walk?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s too far. Let&rsquo;s drive.</p>
