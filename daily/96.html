Lesson 96: Would you mind driving


<p>Hey Michael, I&rsquo;m tired. Would you mind driving for a while?</p>
<p>Sorry. I would like to, but I don&rsquo;t know how to drive.</p>
<p>Really? Don&rsquo;t you have a license? I thought everyone had a license.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve lived in cities all my life and when I&rsquo;m at home I usually take the subway or bus.</p>
<p>I see. Do you think you&rsquo;ll learn to drive in the future?</p>
<p>Yes. I plan to buy a car next year. I think you need one in the US.</p>
<p>Actually, now that I think about it, a lot of people in cities here take the bus also.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to travel more. I&rsquo;ve been here for a few months already and I feel like I haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet.</p>
<p>How are you going to learn to drive? Do you want me to teach you?</p>
<p>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to trouble you. I&rsquo;ve already signed up for a class near my house. It starts next month.&nbsp;</p>
