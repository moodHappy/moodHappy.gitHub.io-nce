Lesson 24: I lost My Watllet
<p>Hey, How&rsquo;s it going?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not good. I lost my wallet.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad. Was it stolen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I think it came out of my pocket when I was in the taxi.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I borrow some money?</p>
<p>Sure, how much do you need?&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 50 dollars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. I&rsquo;ll pay you back on Friday.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be fine. Here you are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are you going to do now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to buy some books and then I&rsquo;m going to the gas station.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wait a minute I can go with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wait for you.</p>
