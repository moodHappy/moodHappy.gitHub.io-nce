Lesson 30: Where do your Parents live?
<p>Hi Melissa, are you going home this weekend?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, not this weekend. I have too much work to do.</p>
<p>Where do your parents live?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father lives in Washington DC.</p>
<p>How about your mother?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mother died two years ago.</p>
<p>Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Is your father still working?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s retired.</p>
<p>Do you have any family here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here.</p>
<p>Do you have any brothers or sisters?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston.</p>
<p>Do you see them a lot?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not as much as I&rsquo;d like to. Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>
