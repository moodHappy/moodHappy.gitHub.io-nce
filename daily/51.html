Lesson 51: Studying for exams

<p>Hi Kim.</p>
<p>Hey Shawn, good to see you again.</p>
<p>How have you been?</p>
<p>OK, I didn&rsquo;t sleep much last night though. I stayed up until 2 AM studying for an exam.</p>
<p>I was up late last night too. The semester is almost over. I&rsquo;ve had exams all week.</p>
<p>Are you going back to California after you graduate?</p>
<p>I think so. After I graduate I&rsquo;ll probably go back home and try to get a job.</p>
<p>Do you know where you&rsquo;d like to work?</p>
<p>Not yet, but I want to be an English translator.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be really cool. I&rsquo;d like to be a translator too, but I don&rsquo;t think my English is good enough.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about that. Your English is better than most of my classmates.</p>
<p>Thanks. Where are you going now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to study at the library. I have to take an exam tomorrow.</p>
<p>Me too. How late does the library stay open?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s open until 11:30 PM.</p>
<p>OK, Good luck.</p>
<p>You too.</p>
