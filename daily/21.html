Lesson 21: The Supermarket is closed
<p>Jeff, I&rsquo;m going to the supermarket. Do you want to come with me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the supermarket is closed now.</p>
<p>Oh, When does it close?</p>
<p>It closes at 7:00 on Sundays.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, we can go tomorrow morning. It opens at 8:00.</p>
<p>Alright. What do you want to do now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets take a walk for a half an hour. My sister will get here at about 8:30PM and then we can all go out to dinner.</p>
<p>Where does she live?&nbsp;</p>
<p>She lives in San Francisco.</p>
<p>How long has she lived there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s lived there for about 10 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long time. Where did she live before that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>San Diego.</p>
