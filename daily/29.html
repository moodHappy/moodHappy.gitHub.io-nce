Lesson 29: Going to the Library
<p>Lisa, would you like to go to the library with me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first?</p>
<p>Sure. First we&rsquo;ll go buy a newspaper and then we&rsquo;ll go to the library.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we going to walk or drive?</p>
<p>The weather is really nice today. Let&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weather is good now, but I think it&rsquo;s suppose to rain this afternoon.</p>
<p>Alright, then let&rsquo;s take an umbrella. Is your brother coming with us?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s still sleeping.</p>
<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s already 10:00AM. He must have been up late last night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, he didn&rsquo;t come home until 12:00AM.</p>
<p>I hope he can come later.</p>
<p>I hope so too. I&rsquo;ll give him a call when we get there.</p>
<p>How do we get to the library from here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s straight down this road on the left, next to the museum. It takes about 10 minutes.</p>
