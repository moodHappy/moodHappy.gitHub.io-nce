Lesson 76: I brought you an apple


<p>Hey, how did you get here?</p>
<p>I rode my bike.</p>
<p>Are you serious? Why did you do that? I could have picked you up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s OK, I didn&rsquo;t want to bother you. I know you don&rsquo;t like to wake up early.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so nice of you. Aren&rsquo;t you cold?</p>
<p>No, not really. I wore a coat.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the bag?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special type of apple.</p>
<p>Oh. Can I try one? It&rsquo;s very sweet.</p>
<p>I put sugar on it. These apples are really good. They were only 30 cents each.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t those more expensive than the ones at the supermarket?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re more expensive, but they taste better.</p>
<p>Did you buy any other fruit?</p>
<p>Well, besides the apples, I bought oranges and bananas.</p>
