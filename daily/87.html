Lesson 87: Shopping for a friend


<p>I&rsquo;m going shopping. Do you want to come?</p>
<p>I thought you went shopping yesterday.</p>
<p>I did, but an old friend called me last night and invited me to his birthday party. I need to buy a gift for him.</p>
<p>I see. What are you going to get him?</p>
<p>I really have no idea what he likes. I haven&rsquo;t seen him in a long time. What do you think?</p>
<p>Maybe a cake?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good idea, but I think I should probably get him something else, like something he can wear.</p>
<p>How about a sweater? I saw a really nice one in the mall the other day. Maybe we can go there and take a look.</p>
<p>OK, what store was it in?</p>
<p>It was at Macy&rsquo;s. I think they&rsquo;re having a sale this weekend.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a really nice store. I like the clothes there.</p>
