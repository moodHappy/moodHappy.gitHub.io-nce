Lesson 36: I need to do laundry
<p>Hi Anna, come in.</p>
<p>Wow, your apartment is a mess.</p>
<p>I know, I didn&rsquo;t have time to put things away before you got here.</p>
<p>Look! Are those all your clothes on the couch?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are they clean?</p>
<p>Actually, most of them are dirty. I haven&rsquo;t done laundry in a while. I usually wait until I can do it at my parent&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street. Why don&rsquo;t you go there?</p>
<p>I know I should, but that place isn&rsquo;t very convenient. You have to wait for a long time.</p>
<p>Yes I know. I have to do it every week. Anyway, are you ready to go?</p>
<p>No I&rsquo;m not ready yet. I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face. Can you wait for a few minutes?</p>
<p>OK, but please hurry. I think the restaurant is closing soon.&nbsp;</p>
