Lesson 39: I ate at the Hotel
<p>Hi Maria, did you have breakfast yet?</p>
<p>Yes, I ate at the hotel with my son and my husband.</p>
<p>Oh, they have good food there. What did you have?</p>
<p>I had some cereal, fried eggs, and orange juice.</p>
<p>How was it?</p>
<p>The food didn&rsquo;t taste very good, and actually, I don&rsquo;t feel very well now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too bad. Do you want to take a break?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m going to go back to the hotel at lunchtime to lie down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to the drug store later. Is there anything I can get for you?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s OK. I think if I rest for a little while, I&rsquo;ll feel better.</p>
