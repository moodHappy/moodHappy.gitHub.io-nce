Lesson 42: Helping a friend move
<p>Kelly, will you help me take these things to the car?</p>
<p>OK, which car do you want me to put them in?</p>
<p>Bring them to my wife&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Which one is hers?</p>
<p>The blue SUV in front of the Honda.</p>
<p>What should I take first?</p>
<p>That chair over there, but please be careful with it. It was a gift from my mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t drop it. Wow, it&rsquo;s really heavy. I don&rsquo;t think I can move it by myself.</p>
<p>Let me help you with that. I don&rsquo;t want you to hurt your back.</p>
<p>Where are you taking all this stuff?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? We&rsquo;re moving to Florida?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re moving now? I knew you were moving, but I thought you said you were moving next month.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true, but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away.</p>
