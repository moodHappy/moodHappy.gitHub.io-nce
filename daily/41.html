Lesson 41: The food tastes great
<p>How do you like the food?</p>
<p>It tastes really great. Did you cook it?</p>
<p>Yes. I made it this afternoon. Would you like some more?</p>
<p>OK, just a little though. I&rsquo;m really full.</p>
<p>Oh. Would you like some soup instead?</p>
<p>What kind is it?</p>
<p>Tomato and rice. Have you had that before?</p>
<p>No. This is my first time. How does it taste?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, try it. What do you think?</p>
<p>Wow. It is good. Did you make that also?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a really good cook.</p>
<p>Thanks, next time I&rsquo;ll make chicken soup for us.</p>
<p>That sounds good. Did you study cooking in school?</p>
<p>No, I learned by myself. I have a good cookbook that I read when I have time.&nbsp;</p>
