Lesson 100: Book club

<p>Hey John, can I talk to you for a minute?</p>
<p>Sure, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>I wanted to let you know about a book club I joined a couple of months ago. I know you do a lot of reading so I thought you might want to come with me next month.</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds like fun. When does the group meet?</p>
<p>Usually the last Saturday of the month at 9:30 in the evening. Is that too late for you?</p>
<p>No, I think that&rsquo;s ok. What do you talk about in the group?</p>
<p>Well, every month we choose a new book and then during the next meeting we discuss it.</p>
<p>What book are you reading now?</p>
<p>The Kite Runner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that&rsquo;s a good book. What&rsquo;s it about?</p>
<p>It is a good book. I&rsquo;m almost finished. The book is about a boy who grows up in Afghanistan during the 1980s. It&rsquo;s called the Kite Runner because the main character takes part in a kite flying competition.</p>
<p>That sounds really interesting. I&rsquo;d love to come.</p>
<p>Ok, great. The next meeting isn&rsquo;t for another two weeks, so you still have time to read the book.</p>
