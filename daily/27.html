Lesson 27: I Went Shopping
<p>Sarah, what did you do today?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went shopping.</p>
<p>Did you buy anything?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I bought a few things.</p>
<p>What did you buy?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought this coat. Do you like it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I like it a lot. It&rsquo;s very pretty. Where did you buy it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the mall on 5th street.</p>
<p>Was it expensive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t expensive. It was on sale for 20 dollars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cheap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know. It was a really good deal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll need to wear it for a while. It&rsquo;s been really hot lately.&nbsp;</p>
