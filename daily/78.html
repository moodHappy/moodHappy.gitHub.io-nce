Lesson 78: Jim canceled the meeting


<p>Hey, I just talked to Jim.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>He said he had to cancel the meeting this afternoon.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Is there a problem?</p>
<p>No, It&rsquo;s not a big deal. He and I were supposed to talk to some new customers today.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK. This has been happening quite a bit recently.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s strange. I wonder why?</p>
<p>His wife has been sick, so sometimes he has to go home early to take care of her.</p>
<p>I see. How&rsquo;s work been going?</p>
<p>Things are slow right now. Would you mind if I borrow your phone, mine&rsquo;s out of batteries and I have to call my boss to tell him about this.</p>
<p>OK, let me go get it. It&rsquo;s in the car.</p>
