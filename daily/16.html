Lesson 16: Asking about Location
<p>Excuse me, I&rsquo;m looking for the Holiday Inn. Do you know where it is?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure. It&rsquo;s down this street on the left.</p>
<p>Is it far from here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not far.</p>
<p>How far is it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>About a mile and a half.</p>
<p>How long does it take to get there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Is it close to the subway station?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s very close. The subway station is next to the hotel. You can walk there.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
