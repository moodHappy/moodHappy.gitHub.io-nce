Lesson 54: Mail

<p>Hey Jane, did you get the mail yet?</p>
<p>Yes. I picked it up this morning. There were a few bills and a letter from my mother. There was also a lot of junk mail.</p>
<p>Was there anything for me?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember, let me check. Yes, it looks like there&rsquo;s something here for you.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s it from?</p>
<p>The American Embassy.</p>
<p>My hands are dirty. Will you open it for me?</p>
<p>What does it say?</p>
<p>It says your passport is ready. You can pick it up anytime.</p>
<p>Do you think you can drive me there?</p>
<p>Sure, when?</p>
<p>I think we should go get it now. I&rsquo;m going to wash my hands and then we&rsquo;ll go. Is that OK?&nbsp;</p>
