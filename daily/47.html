Lesson 47: Talking about the Weather
<p>It&rsquo;s almost Christmas. What are you doing this weekend?</p>
<p>Nothing special, just working. Why do you ask?</p>
<p>Well, I still haven&rsquo;t finished my Christmas shopping. Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I can. Work has been really busy lately. Why don&rsquo;t we go on Friday instead?</p>
<p>Friday&rsquo;s not good. I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work.</p>
<p>OK, then let&rsquo;s try to go this weekend. I should know if I can go by Friday. Is it OK if I call you then?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your number?</p>
<p>233-331-8828. Let me give you my email address too. It&rsquo;s sara@gmail.com</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll talk to you soon.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
