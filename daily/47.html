<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hi Tina, It&rsquo;s Joe.</p>
<p>Hi Joe.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s the weather there today?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cold. It snowed all day and the schools closed early.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the temperature?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 30 degrees now. It was even colder this morning.</p>
<p>Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?</p>
<p>I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it&rsquo;s probably going to snow tomorrow.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like the winter. I wish it were summer.</p>
<p>Me too. How&rsquo;s the weather where you are?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too bad, but it&rsquo;s pretty cold here too. It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon. I heard it&rsquo;s going to be a little warmer tomorrow.</p>
