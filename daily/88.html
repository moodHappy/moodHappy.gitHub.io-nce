Lesson 88: What is your major

<p>Hey Diane, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Hi, Tim, how are you? I&rsquo;m waiting for a friend.</p>
<p>I heard you&rsquo;re going to graduate this summer. Is that true?</p>
<p>Yes. If everything goes alright, I&rsquo;ll be getting my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in August. Then I need to start looking for a job.</p>
<p>I had to do that last year. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. Do you have any job offers?</p>
<p>No, not yet. I sent out a lot of resumes, but I didn&rsquo;t receive many responses. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to find a job right now.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your major?</p>
<p>Psychology.</p>
<p>That was my major when I started college, but I switched to engineering after the first year.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier for engineers to find a job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about that. It took me about 3 months to find a job. I finally was able to get a job after I put my resume on one of those job websites.</p>
<p>Anyway, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. If I can&rsquo;t find a job I&rsquo;ll probably go back to school to get my Masters degree.</p>
