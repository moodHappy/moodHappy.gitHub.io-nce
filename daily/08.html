Lesson 8: Choosing a time to meet
<p>Jennifer, would you like to have dinner with me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. That would be nice. When do you want to go?</p>
<p>Is today OK?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I can&rsquo;t go today.</p>
<p>How about tomorrow night?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok. What time?</p>
<p>Is 9:00 PM all right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Is 6:00 PM OK?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s good. Where would you like to go?</p>
<p>The Italian restaurant on 5th street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t like that Restaurant. I don&rsquo;t want to go there.</p>
<p>How about the Korean restaurant next to it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, I like that place.</p>
