Lesson 97: Your English is so good


<p>Thomas, your English is so good. How did you learn it?</p>
<p>Well, in my country everyone has to take English starting in the first grade. I&rsquo;ve been taking English courses for 12 years now.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s interesting. I remember when we took that trip last year and visited your family. It seemed like there weren&rsquo;t many people that could speak with me in English.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t speak English that much.</p>
<p>But they speak it in school, right? Maybe they just didn&rsquo;t like me so they didn&rsquo;t want to talk to me.</p>
<p>No, actually they liked you a lot. They told me they thought you were very nice. They are just shy. They&rsquo;re not used to talking with foreigners. I remember when I first came to the US. I was really nervous about speaking with people.</p>
<p>I see. I thought there were lots of Americans teaching English in your country.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true. There are probably twice as many now as there were five years ago, but they are mostly in the cities. My family lives in the country.</p>
<p>I wonder why. Personally, I prefer the country to the city. It&rsquo;s so quiet and peaceful. If I were to teach, I would want to teach in the country.</p>
<p>Do you think you would want to teach someday? I know the schools around my town are looking for teachers, so if you want, I can call them and get more information.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I would need to stay there for a year, and I don&rsquo;t think I can take that much time off work.</p>
<p>Well, if you change your mind, let me know. I think you would be a really great teacher.&nbsp;</p>
