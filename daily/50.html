Lesson 50: Iâ€™m Student
<p>Craig, what do you do for work?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a student.</p>
<p>What school do you go to?</p>
<p>Boston University.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good school. What do you study?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m studying English, math, and history. My major is English.</p>
<p>How long have you been studying English?</p>
<p>More than six years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I started to learn English when I was in high school.</p>
<p>No wonder your English is so good.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s not that good. I can read but I can&rsquo;t speak very well. I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of chances to practice.</p>
<p>I see. Talking with other people is very important.</p>
<p>Yes, but I still don&rsquo;t have many friends here yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a party tonight at my apartment. You should come.</p>
<p>Oh thanks for inviting me. I&rsquo;d love to come.&nbsp;</p>
