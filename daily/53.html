Lesson 53: Making a doctor’s appointment

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;d like to see the doctor, please.</p>
<p>Do you have an appointment?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>When would you like an appointment?</p>
<p>Is today possible?</p>
<p>Yes. Today is fine. What time would you like?</p>
<p>As soon as possible. My stomach really hurts.</p>
<p>Please wait a moment. I&rsquo;ll see if the doctor is available.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Sorry, he&rsquo;s with a patient right now. It&rsquo;s probably going to be about another 30 minutes. Would you mind waiting a little longer?</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>May I see your insurance card, please?</p>
<p>Here you are.</p>
<p>Thanks. That&rsquo;s going to be 25 dollars for today&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>Really? I didn&rsquo;t think it would be that much.</p>
<p>I know how you feel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pay with cash.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Would you please turn on the heat? It&rsquo;s really cold in here.</p>
<p>It is cold in here, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll take care of that in a moment. Please have a seat and fill out these forms. Bring them back to me when you&rsquo;re done.</p>
