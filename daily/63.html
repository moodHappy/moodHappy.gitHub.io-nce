Lesson: 63: I changed my mind


<p>Kevin, what would you like to do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe watch TV.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good idea. We&rsquo;re going shopping later so I think you should rest for a while.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I want to go anymore.</p>
<p>What do you mean? I thought you said we were going shopping.</p>
<p>I know, but I changed my mind. I&rsquo;m too tired.</p>
<p>Well, I still have a lot of stuff to buy. When do you think we&rsquo;ll go?</p>
<p>Maybe tonight.</p>
<p>OK, would you mind if I use your phone?</p>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t have a signal.</p>
<p>Are you kidding? I usually have really good reception here.</p>
<p>My phone is very old and it doesn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>What if I take it outside?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s fine. It works well outside.&nbsp;</p>
