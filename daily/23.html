Lesson 23: Help with Pronunciation
<p>William, do you like studying English?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like studying English, and I can read well, but speaking can be difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad. If you talk to your American friends every day, you&rsquo;ll learn quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Sure, what do you want to know?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my book from class here. How do you say this word?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Laptop &lsquo;</p>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t understand. What does that mean?</p>
<p>A laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you. Do you understand?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I think so. Can you say it again?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Laptop&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Laptop&rsquo;. Did I pronounce that correctly?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s very good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. And this word? How do you pronounce this?</p>
<p>That word is pronounced &lsquo;kitchen&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much. You&rsquo;re a good teacher.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
