Lesson 4: Asking for directions
<p>Hi Michael.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Amy. What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for the airport. Can you tell me how to get there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, sorry. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think I can take the subway to the airport. Do you know where the subway is?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s over there.</p>
<p>Where? I don&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the street.</p>
<p>Oh, I see it now. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Do you know if there&rsquo;s a restroom around here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s one here. It&rsquo;s in the store.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye bye.&nbsp;</p>
