Lesson 34: Putting things in order
<p>Michelle, Can you help me clean things up before we go?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure. Where should I put this cup?</p>
<p>Which cup?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The red one.</p>
<p>Put it on top of the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about this fruit?</p>
<p>Oh, that goes in the refrigerator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And those pencils? What should I do with them?</p>
<p>Bring those upstairs and put them in the bedroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about this pen?</p>
<p>Give it to me. I need to use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you want me to do with that paper over there?</p>
<p>You can throw that away. I don&rsquo;t need it anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trash is full.</p>
<p>Alright, then please put it in a bag and take it outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re finished. Can you please turn off the lights and shut the door?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
