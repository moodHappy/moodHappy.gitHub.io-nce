Lesson 40: Going to the Movies
<p>Ann, what do you want to do tonight?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to go see a movie.</p>
<p>I heard Titanic is playing at the movie theater.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve heard that&rsquo;s a good movie. What time does it start?</p>
<p>6:30 PM. It&rsquo;s a long movie. I think it lasts for about 3 hours.</p>
<p>Will you come and pick me up?</p>
<p>What time?</p>
<p>I think we should get there early because they might be sold out. Is 5:00 PM OK?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;ll meet you at your house at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Do you want to get something to eat before the movie?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there will be enough time for that. We can have popcorn and hot dogs at the theater if you want.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the popcorn they have there. I think they put too much salt on it.</p>
<p>OK then, I&rsquo;ll pick you up a little earlier and we can go to the Thai restaurant next to the theater, is that OK?</p>
<p>Yes, I like that place.</p>
