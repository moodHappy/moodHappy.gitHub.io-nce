<p>Excuse me. Do you know how to get to the mall?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, I used to work there. Go straight for about a mile, then turn left at the light. The mall will be on the right.</p>
<p>Do you know the address?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the address is 541 Main street.</p>
<p>Can you write it down for me please?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Is it faster if I take Highland avenue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, that way is longer. There are more stop lights on that street.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
