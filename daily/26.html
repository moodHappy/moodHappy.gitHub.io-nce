Lesson 26: Family Trip
<p>David, what have you been up to lately?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went on a trip with my family last week.</p>
<p>Really? Where did you go?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We went to Europe.</p>
<p>What cities did you go to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>London, Paris and a few other smaller cities.</p>
<p>Did you go to Berlin?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, We didn&rsquo;t go there. I&rsquo;d like to go there next time.</p>
<p>I think the summer is a good time to visit Berlin. It&rsquo;s a beautiful place and the people there are very nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>I went there last year. If you want, I can give you some information I have about the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
