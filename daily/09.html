Lesson 9: When do you want to go?
<p>Hi Mark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>What are you planning to do today?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure yet.</p>
<p>Would you like to have lunch with me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. When?</p>
<p>Is 11:30 AM OK?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t hear you. Can you say that again, please?</p>
<p>I said, 11:30 AM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m busy then. Can we meet a little later?</p>
<p>OK, how about 12:30 PM?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>How about Bill&rsquo;s Seafood Restaurant?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, Where is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on 7th Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll meet you there.</p>
