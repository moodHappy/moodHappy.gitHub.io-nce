Lesson 49: Meeting a Friend
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hi Vicky.</p>
<p>Are you there yet?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I just got off the subway. I&rsquo;m almost there. Sorry, I&rsquo;m late.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no problem. I just wanted to tell you I&rsquo;m inside.</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>On the second floor.</p>
<p>Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor?</p>
<p>Come upstairs.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, Can you hear me OK? I said, come to the second floor.</p>
<p>Oh, OK. What are you doing there?</p>
<p>Just looking at some books on how to learn English.</p>
<p>Do you want to get something to eat later?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m still full from dinner.</p>
<p>What do you want to do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure. When you get here we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>OK, see you soon.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
