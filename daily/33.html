Lesson 33: Buying a plane ticket
<p>Next, please. Hello. How can I help you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to buy a ticket to New York.</p>
<p>Would you like one way or round trip?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Round trip.</p>
<p>When will you be leaving?&nbsp;</p>
<p>When does the next plane leave?</p>
<p>In about 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like a ticket for that flight, please.</p>
<p>First class or coach?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coach. OK, let me check availability. I&rsquo;m sorry. Tickets for that flight are sold out.</p>
<p>How about the one after that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me see. Yes, that one still has seats available. Would you like me to reserve a seat for you?</p>
<p>Yes, please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be 120 dollars.</p>
<p>Thank you, here&rsquo;s your change.</p>
