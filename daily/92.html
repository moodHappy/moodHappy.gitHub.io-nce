Lesson 92: Do you know how to get downtown


<p>Hi George, do you know how to get downtown?</p>
<p>Sure. Why are you going there?</p>
<p>I want to buy a new computer.</p>
<p>OK, are you driving?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Go straight down this road. When you get to the second light, take a left. Then get on the highway and take exit 52.</p>
<p>That sounds really complicated. Can you tell me again? Which road do I take first?</p>
<p>You go down this road, then at the second light, turn left. That road is Main street.</p>
<p>OK, I think I&rsquo;ve got it now.</p>
<p>Why are you buying a new computer anyway? Didn&rsquo;t you just get one a few months ago?</p>
<p>Yes, but it doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
<p>Where did you buy it?</p>
<p>At Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>I think your computer should still be under warranty. You can bring it back to them and they&rsquo;ll fix it for free.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right. I didn&rsquo;t think about that. I should go talk to them about it. Where is the closest Wal-Mart?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 2 blocks from here. I have to go there to get some stuff now anyway. Do you want to follow me?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
