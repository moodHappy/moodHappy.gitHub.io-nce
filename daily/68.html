Lesson: 68: I have allergies


<p>Patrick, why didn&rsquo;t you call me last night? I was worried about you.</p>
<p>Sorry, I was sick. I went to bed early.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>I had a cough and my eyes were really dry.</p>
<p>Are you better now?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m feeling a lot better. Much better than yesterday.</p>
<p>Do you have allergies?</p>
<p>Yes. The last time I went to the doctor, he did some tests and told me I have allergies. It gets worse in the spring.</p>
<p>What time did you wake up this morning?</p>
<p>Around 9:30 AM.</p>
<p>Are you going to work today?</p>
<p>No. I think I&rsquo;ll just stay home and watch TV. I can work from home today.</p>
<p>Good. Get some rest and I&rsquo;ll bring over some food later.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
