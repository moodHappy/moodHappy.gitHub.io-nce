Lesson 12: Do you have enough money?
<p>Laura, what are you going to do today?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going shopping.</p>
<p>What time are you leaving?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to leave around 4 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Will you buy a ham sandwich for me at the store?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have enough money?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>How much do you have?&nbsp;</p>
<p>25 dollars. Do you think that&rsquo;s enough?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not very much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s OK. I also have two credit cards.</p>
<p>Let me give you another ten dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. See you later.</p>
<p>Bye.&nbsp;</p>
