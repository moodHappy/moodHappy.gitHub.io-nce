Lesson 15: Buying a Shirt
<p>Excuse me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello sir, may I help you?</p>
<p>Yes. Can I see that shirt on the top shelf please?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure. Here it is.</p>
<p>How much does it cost?&nbsp;</p>
<p>50 dollars.</p>
<p>50 dollars. That&rsquo;s too much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about this one? It&rsquo;s on sale for only 35 dollars.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about the one next to the black gloves? It&rsquo;s very similar to the one you like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice. How much is it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>30 dollars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this color OK, or would you like a different color?</p>
<p>That blue one&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you need any more of these shirts?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many do you want?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take two more, a red one and a white one.&nbsp;</p>
