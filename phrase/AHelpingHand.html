A Helping Hand
<p>Bob: Hey Alice, could you spare me a bit of sugar?</p>

<p>Alice: Sure, here you go. Just a bit though, I'm running low myself.</p>

<p>Bob: Thanks! I'll return it later.</p>

<p>Alice: No problem. By the way, could I borrow a copy of that book you mentioned?</p>

<p>Bob: Of course, I have a copy of it at home. I'll bring it tomorrow.</p>

<p>Alice: Great, thanks! Oh, and do you have a bottle of water? I forgot mine today.</p>

<p>Bob: Yeah, here's a bottle of water. Just make sure to return it.</p>

<p>Alice: Thanks, you're a lifesaver!</p>

<p>Bob: No worries, glad to help.</p>
