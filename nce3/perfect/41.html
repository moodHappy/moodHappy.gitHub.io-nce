<p>Text 课文:</p>
<p>Illusions of Pastoral peace 宁静田园生活的遐想</p>
<p>The quiet life of the country（the quiet country life） has never appealed to me. （背诵）在论述好处坏处的时候，应该在第一句话时救应该表达个人的意见。组织一篇议论文时，主要有三段：开头段、支持段和结尾段。在开头段中的第一句话或是最后一句话讲明观点。 City born and city bred. （独立主格结构，as I was born and bred in a city）</p>
<p>I have always regarded the country as (think of &hellip; as&hellip; / refer to &hellip; as) something you look at through a train window, or something you occasional visit during the weekend. (扩展句进行说明你的观点)。Most of my friends live in the city, yet （however） they always go into raptures at the mere mention (at the mere mention of / at the sight of/ at the news of / at the touch of / at the mention of ) of the country. （具体的事例进行说明观点，例子在文章中是必不可少的）</p>
<p>Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life (从本课开始，注意文章的安排，结构的布局和关键词的重复，引导让步状语从句，应注意其主句), only one of hem has ever gone to live in the country and he was back in town within six months. （discussion: why writer talk about this sentence: hypocritical 虚伪ie: The country life never appeals to me, and never appeals to others. 从反面进行论述）&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life.（背诵，the writer emphasizes that his friend is hypocritical）(the life of country / the country / country life重复使用关键词能够引导读者跟着你的思路走)&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the gentle pace of living. （Discussion: why writer talks about the virtue of country life? 作者的意图是讨论城市生活优于乡村生活，为什么要提及乡村生活的美德呢？Every picture has two sides, 应论述其好处，再进行逐一否决）</p>
<p>Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cockcrow, the twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. （the writer illustrates the country life advantageous further）</p>
<p>This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture.（背诵，从下文开始使用对比法进行论述） My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV -- virtually the only form of entertainment. He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or（表并列）about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me.（本文重点句：背诵 why 所引导的从句&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. stand / bear / put up with / endure / tolerate&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. dubious: doubtful / uncertain）</p>
<p>They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong. (Conclusion: the writer illustrates the topic: the country life is never appeals to him. The writer talks about both advantages and disadvantages of country life in order to comparison, but he did not draw the conclusion about the comparison.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can do without (manage/do without没有&hellip;也能忍受eg: I can do without car. ) the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer. （背诵）There are advantages of living in the country, but there are few living in the country than living in the big city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You never have to travel miles to see your friends. They invariably(always) live nearby and are always available (able to be used anytime, 主要是用做表语，也可以用于定语，用做定语放在被修饰词的后面eg: I am available to have a chat with you. The books in our classroom are available for you. I have a dictionary available for you.) for an informal chat or an evening's entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat. For them this is a major (demanding：要求高的，需要时间的) operation which involves considerable planning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the play draws to its close （near its end）, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home. The cit dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort. （背诵eg: We can keep ourselves free from the anxieties of this sort which afflict the country dweller. Eating food with different taste is also a pleasure. ）&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best. Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with (方式状语) as many of the exotic items as they can carry. （背诵）&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nor is the city without its moments of beauty.（双重否定表肯定）&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is something comforting about the warm glow shed （流泻）by advertisements on cold wet winter nights. Few things could be more impressive than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has always been a mystery to me who city dwellers, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country. 结论句与第一段第一句进行呼应。</p>
