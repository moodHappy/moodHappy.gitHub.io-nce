<p>amazed 惊奇的</p>
<p>The custom officer's face lit up as soon as he saw the tiny bottle on the bottom of my suitcase.</p>
<p>However, it was how turn to be surprised, for the girl's eyes immediately lit up and she fetched several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For once, Harry had to admit defeat. He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price.&nbsp;</p>
