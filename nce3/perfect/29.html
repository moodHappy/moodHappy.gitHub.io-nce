<p>Text 课文</p>
<p>What is the basis of&lsquo;sick&rsquo;humour?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on where we have been brought up.</p>
<p>The sense of humour is mysteriously bound up with national characteristics.</p>
<p>A Frenchman, for instance, might find it hard to laugh at a Russian joke.</p>
<p>I found it difficult to finish the work in a day.</p>
<p>It was difficult not to be attempted.</p>
<p>In the same way, a Russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke which would make</p>
<p>an Englishman laugh to tears.</p>
<p>Most funny stories are based on comic situations.</p>
<p>be based upon&hellip; 基于&hellip;</p>
<p>-- This news report is based entirely on fact. 这篇新闻报导是完全根据实际情况写成的。</p>
<p>In spite of national differences, certain funny situations have a universal appeal.</p>
<p>No matter where you live, you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say, Charlie Chaplin's</p>
<p>early films.</p>
<p>However, a new type of humour, which stems largely from the U.S., has recently come into</p>
<p>fashion.</p>
<p>stem from 源自, 起源于</p>
<p>-- His feeling of hate stem from envy.（n.羡慕, 妒嫉）</p>
<p>-- Her interest in flowers stemmed from her childhood in the country.</p>
<p>stem from 源自, 起源于</p>
<p>= come from 出身于, 由...引起, 是...的结果, 是在...生长大的</p>
<p>= arise from 由...而引起, 由...而产生</p>
<p>= originate from 由某人发起(首创)</p>
<p>Originate vi.发源, 开始, 发生</p>
<p>-- The quarrel originated in a misunderstanding. 争吵是由于误解而引起的。</p>
<p>-- The film originated from a short story. 这部电影取材于一篇短篇小说。</p>
<p>Originate vt.使产生, 创始, 创办, 发明, 发起, 引起</p>
<p>-- They originated the plan. 他们首先提出这一计划。</p>
<p>come into fashion 流行起来, 开始风行</p>
<p>come into power (开始)掌权, 上台</p>
<p>call into being 使产生, 使出现, 建立, 成立</p>
<p>It is called&lsquo;sick humour&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Comedians base their jokes on tragic situations like violent death or serious accidents.</p>
<p>Many people find this sort of joke distasteful.</p>
<p>The following example of&lsquo;sick humour&rsquo;will enable you to judge for yourself.</p>
<p>A man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas.</p>
<p>From the moment he arrived there, he kept on pestering his doctor to tell him when he</p>
<p>would be able to go home.</p>
<p>He dreaded having to spend Christmas in hospital.</p>
<p>Dread to do = dread doing</p>

<p>-- I arrive here by train.</p>
<p>The following day, however, the doctor consoled him by telling him that his chances of being</p>
<p>able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good.</p>
