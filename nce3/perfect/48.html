<p>Lesson 48 The silent village 沉默的村庄</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>In this much-travelled world, there are still thousands of places which are in-accessible to tourists. We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable. But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers. Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable--as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans .</p>
<p>We had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity. These attracted many visitors for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well. On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town. This was more than we could bear , so we decided to spend our last day exploring the country- side. Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood. We expected the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees. We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream. We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream. Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank. In it there was a boatman fast asleep. We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side. Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually persuaded him to take us.</p>
<p>The path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain. The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses. Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks. The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat tied to a tree on a short length of rope in a field nearby. Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch. All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm. Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate. We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless. I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers. When we later walked down the main street of the village, we were followed by a silent procession of children. The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life. Faces appeared at windows. Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us. Old women in black shawls peered at us from door-ways. The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard. There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors. We needed no further warning. Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.</p>

<p>到真正遥远的山村参观很少给你带来乐趣的，As引导非限定性定语从句用破折号隔开。33课提及。</p>
<p>第一自然很重要，最好全文背下来。比如In&nbsp;this much-travelled world；We always&nbsp;assume that&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;；who are cut off not only from&hellip;&hellip;but even from。通过这一段我们了解到为什么偏僻山村的人对人怀有敌意。是因为他们本身已经脱离了这个社会。</p>
<p>These attracted many visitors ,for they were not only of great architectural interest , but contained a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well, On the day before our departure several bus loads of tourists descended on the town .</p>
<p>Of great interest 有意识的</p>
<p>Beautifully &ndash;preserved 被保存得很漂亮</p>
<p>On the day before our departure</p>
<p>在我们离开的前一天</p>
<p>several bus loads of tourists</p>
<p>好几辆坐满乘客的大巴</p>
<p>Taking a path which led out of the town ,we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood</p>
<p>came to a dense wood出城影 / trace its way继续向前延伸，trace跟踪他的路线，穿过树林，继续向前延伸</p>
<p>make one&rsquo;s way out of 挤出出 / fight one&rsquo;s way 拼出一条路来，杀出一条路</p>

<p>We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived a deep stream. We could see that the path continued on the other side. but we had no idea how we could get across the stream.</p>
<p>表示这条路程继续向前延伸用continued，相当于trace its way; on the无伦次other side指小溪的另一岸</p>
<p>but we had no idea how we could get across the stream 。we had no idea 可以改成we didn&rsquo;t know how we could get across the stream, how we could get across the stream是作同位语说明no idea 的内涵，如果改成we didn&rsquo;t know 是how引导的宾语从句.，无论改成那种语气，后面的语句必须是陈述句，how we could..</p>
<p>Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank. In it there was a boatman fast asleep</p>
<p>a boat moored to the bank 停在岸边的一艘小船,moored过去分词作定语。</p>
<p>a boatman fast asleep 一个睡得很香的船夫，asleep只能作表语，如果作定语放在修饰词的后面。Fast副词修饰asleep，一个睡得很香的船夫。</p>
<p>Though he was reluctant to do so at first ,we eventually persuaded him to take us</p>
<p>Eventually替换为at last，因为毕竟是终于成功的，不要替换成in the end.</p>
<p>The path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain. The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses.</p>
<p>Perched,是栖息，及物动词过去分词作定语，视为定语从句必须用被动。高高座落在山坡上的一个小山村</p>
<p>一本题名为如何在一分钟内读1000字的书</p>
<p>A book entitled how to read thousands word in the minter</p>
<p>The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses.</p>
<p>straggling unmade用来修饰road, The place consisted of由什么组成是它的谓语动词，straggling unmade用来修饰road，这个地方是由乱七八糟的未人工修饰的路所组成，on either side用either作定词所修饰的名词必须是单数形式，作起的作用是一个复数概念。on either side = on both sides。 On both side of road&nbsp;</p>
<p>which 指代的是road,，which was 是前面用过unmade，为避免重复用定语从句被动语态。</p>
<p>Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks .the village seemed deserted</p>
<p>Forbidding与inaccessible 相呼应，让人望而却步。 As改成for没有问题。</p>
<p>The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat tied to a tree on a short length of rope in a field nearby.</p>
<p>被废弃的，空空荡荡的。The village seemed deserted这个村里没人居住，才显得空荡荡的。the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat tied to a tree on a short length of rope in a field nearby.这句话没有谓语动词，不是完整的语句，没有连接词，简单句之间用逗号分开，没有连接词，逗号后面的内容是一个独立主格结构，进一步对前句作一个补充解释。</p>
<p>the only sign of life唯一的生命迹象，ugly-looking喻境的描述十分重要，不喜欢这个村庄就用an ugly-looking black goat,名词和现在分词搭配构成了一个独立主格结构。对前句进行补充说明。</p>
<p>All at once,I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm</p>
<p>all at once = almost immediately 几乎就在同时</p>
<p>Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate</p>
<p>Looking up，sitting down现在分词做短语。当我抬起头的时候，I saw 发出的一个动作。in rags修饰children。who were looking at us引导的定语从句依旧修饰children</p>
<p>I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers. When we later walked down</p>
<p>我得出一个结论他们只是由于腼腆怕见陌生人。</p>
<p>The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life.</p>
<p>和上文的The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat相呼应。上句用The village seemed deserted，一般过去式。这村庄似乎空无一人，本句中采用The village which had seemed deserted，采用过去玩成时，所以为了突出，就在翻译的时候表达成：似乎刚刚还空无一人的村庄，马上就活过来了。</p>
<p>Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us. Old women in black shawls peered at us from door-ways</p>
<p>看主干Men glaredat us，恶狠狠的看着我们。children用look at，成年人憎恨心里更强，用glare at 看，青壮年男子恶狠狠的目光，老太太的眼神很差，看用peer at，眯着眼睛</p>
<p>The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard.</p>
<p>平行句式Men in &hellip;old women in&hellip;对当时的情形进行描写，所有这些最让人害怕 是that引导的表语从句not a sound could be heard一点声音都听不到，这是他们不能忍受的。.有时候沉默意味敌意。</p>
<p>There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors.</p>
<p>There was no doubt = Beyond doubt.毫无疑问</p>
<p>there was no doubt 毫无疑问=句here is no doubt that/without any doubts</p>
<p>we needed no further warning我们不需要别人对我们的警告</p>
<p>further 加强语气。</p>
<p>Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.</p>
<p>Turning back down动作由谓语发出来的。所以又沿着主路回去了，我们加快了我们的脚步，尽快赶回到made our way rapidly towards where定语修饰stream</p>
<p>重点复习</p>
<p>现在分词作状语</p>
<p>定语从句</p>
<p>过去分词作定语</p>
<p>looking up</p>
<p>taking back</p>
<p>动词ing一定要和主句主语保持一致。过去分词作定语A boat moored to bank</p>
