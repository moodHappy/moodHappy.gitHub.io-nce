<p>Text 课文</p>
<p>Why did Alf want a white-collar job?</p>
<p>These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who</p>
<p>work in offices.</p>
<p>people who do manual work = blue-collar workers</p>
<p>people who do mental work = white-collar workers = people who work in offices </p>
<p>for more money（far副词用来加强语气= much）</p>
<p>People who work in offices are frequently referred to as "white-collar workers' for the</p>
<p>simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work.</p>
<p>refer to...as = regard...as 把...看作为</p>
<p>-- I always refer to him as bookworm（n.书呆子）</p>
<p>for the simple reason = for 引导的原因状语从句 </p>
<p>for the reason that多用于正式文体，because多用于口语中。</p>
<p>-- He is refer to as a book worm for the simple reason that he spare no efforts reading.</p>
<p>-- He was send to prison for he could not pay his debts.</p>
<p>Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for </p>
<p>the privilege of becoming white-collar workers.</p>
<p>human nature 人性</p>
<p>such...that... （that引导同位语从句, 进一步补充说明such的基本内涵）</p>
<p>-- His kindness was such that we will never forget him.</p>
<p>= Such was his kindness that&hellip; （such在句首要倒装）</p>
<p>= He was so kind that we will never forget him.</p>
<p>-- Such is human nature that we want to get a lot of things free.</p>
<p>介词for表示一种目的</p>
<p>be willing to do sth = be ready to do sth 心甘情愿做 </p>
<p>This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as</p>
<p>a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.</p>
<p>give rise to =（lead to v.导致, 通向）（cause vt.引起, 惹起）（result in v.导致）</p>
<p>-- Such conduct might give rise to misunderstandings. 这种行为会引起误解。</p>
<p>-- The bad conditions have given rise to a lot of crimes. 不良的环境引起了犯罪。</p>
<p>in the case of 就...来说, 关于, 就...而言 （= concerning prep.关于, 涉及, 就...说）</p>
<p>-- Stealing is no shame in the case of him. 偷窃对他来说不是一件可耻的事。</p>
<p>in case of（副词）万一, 以防 ( （in case conj.万一）</p>
<p>-- You should ensure your house in case of fire. （ensure vt.保证; 担保, 保险）</p>
<p>-- Take umbrella in case of rain 带上雨伞以防下雨。</p>
<p>who引导定语从句</p>
<p>When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job.</p>
<p>too embarrassed to say 太尴尬而没有说明</p>
<p>be ashamed of 感到羞愧, 惭愧</p>
<p>-- Alf was ashamed of his job as a dustman.</p>
<p>marry 强调动作 （-- He married the girl. 他娶了这个女孩。）</p>
<p>get married 强调过程（-- Last year they got married.）</p>
<p>be married to sb 强调状态（-- The old man has been married to his wife for 50 years.）</p>
<p>He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation.</p>
<p>Simply 副词--用来修饰限定动词told</p>
<p>Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit.</p>
<p>dressed in a smart black suit --形容词短语表示一种状态 打方框代表有问题</p>
<p>-- He go to work dressed in a beautiful coat. </p>
<p>-- He left home wearing a smart black suit. </p>
<p>He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman.</p>
<p>changed into 换上 / change back into 换回</p>
<p>Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit.</p>
<p>Before returning home = Before he returned home</p>
<p>Before和动名词搭配, 相当于Before引导的时间状语从句。</p>
<p>如果运用动名词形式，动名词的逻辑主语必须是主句的主语</p>
<p>-- After getting home, he had a good rest.</p>
<p>-- Before having dinner, he finished all his homework.</p>
<p>Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret.</p>
<p>Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf </p>
<p>has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office.</p>
<p>she never will = she will never discover the secret</p>
<p>在省略句式中, never要放在助动词之前</p>
<p>-- &ldquo;will you go to see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>-- &ldquo;I will never to to see her" = "No, I never will."</p>
<p>He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well</p>
<p>worth the loss of money.</p>
<p>half as much as</p>
<p>half / a quarter / twice / three times + as...as... 表示倍数</p>
<p>-- I won't marry a man who is twice as old as me.</p>
<p>-- We got three times as many people as we expected.</p>
<p>-- This room is about three times as large as that one.</p>
<p>是...的几倍：...as +形容词或副词原形+ as... </p>
<p>比...多几倍：...times +形容词或副词比较级+ than&hellip;</p>
<p>-- This road is four times longer than that one. = This road is five times as long as that one.</p>
<p>What he obtained is well worth the loss of time. 他的所得是值得花时间的。</p>
<p>well 副词用来加强语气, 修饰形容词worth</p>
