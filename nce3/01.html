<p>When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously.</p>
<p>一般来讲定语从句和同位语从句紧随在被修饰名词的后面，但为了保持句子平衡，也可以把谓语动词放到从句之前</p>
<p>1&gt; 定语从句只是对于被修饰词的补充说明、修饰</p>
<p>-- 定语从句的引导词：</p>
<p>-- 指人：主语who；宾语who, whom；定语 whose</p>
<p>-- 指物：that（也可以指人）/ which</p>
<p>-- 时间状语：when / 地点状语：where / 原因状语：why</p>
<p>2&gt; 同位语从句则是讲述被修饰名词的内容</p>
<p>-- 同位语从句的引导词：</p>
<p>-- 名词(做主语、宾语等)：关系词用that而不是which</p>
<p>-- 时间：when； 地点：where</p>
<p>-- 定语从句中没有what这个关系词，但what可以引导同位语从句</p>
<p>-- An idea came to her that she might do the experiment in another way.</p>
<p>-- I have no idea what has happened to him。</p>
<p>they were not taken seriously（they指代reports）</p>
<p>take sth seriously = deal with sth seriously 认真地对待某事</p>
<p>-- I always take your suggestions seriously.</p>
<p>take sth lightly 草率地对待某事 （lightly adv.轻率地）</p>
<p>-- Don&rsquo;t take the hot potato lightly （hot potato n.棘手的问题）</p>
<p>However, as the evidence began to accumulate,experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p>However adv.然而(起转折作用)</p>
<p>As 连词：随着, 当...之时</p>
<p>过去分词做定语：</p>
<p>-- the descriptions given by people</p>
<p>-- the story told by the sailor (n.海员, 水手, 船员)</p>
<p>-- a book written by Luxun</p>
<p>claim to have done sth 声称曾经做过某事</p>
<p>-- He claimed to have been the manager of the large shop.</p>
<p>The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her.</p>
<p>Where a woman picking&hellip; 定语从句</p>
<p>-- I still remember the school where I studied English.</p>
<p>It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack</p>
<p>a human being unless it is cornered.</p>
<p>Confirm = be sure = be certain (confirm vt.确定)</p>
<p>Unless it is cornered = if it is not cornered (unless conj.如果不, 除非)</p>
<p>-- He will accept the job unless the salary is too low.</p>
<p>The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning</p>
<p>and at another place twenty miles away in the evening.</p>
<p>search = hunt</p>
<p>Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits.</p>
<p>把某物留在后面：leave behind</p>
<p>-- Wherever he went, the wound left behind him a trail of blood.（n.血）</p>
<p>Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes.</p>
<p>英文表达方式习惯用被动语态, 突出客观事实。而中文则善于运用动作的执行者。</p>
<p>puma fur was found clinging to bushes. （被动）</p>
<p>( We found the puma fur clinging to bushes. （主动）</p>
<p>-- clinging to bushes是现在分词短语做宾补</p>
<p>Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip</p>
<p>saw the puma up a tree.</p>
<p>complain of/about sth 抱怨某事</p>
<p>on+名词：强调动作正在进行</p>
<p>-- on the rise 在上升 / on the increase 在增加</p>
<p>-- on the watch 在观看 / on the match 在比赛中</p>
<p>-- on the fishing trip 在钓鱼的途中 / on holiday 在度假</p>
<p>The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come</p>
<p>from?</p>
<p>Fully（adv.充分地, 完全地）= completely = entirely</p>
<p>As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have</p>
<p>been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape.</p>
<p>sth be in the possession of sb = sth be in sb's possession 某物归某人所有(主语是物)</p>
<p>-- The beautiful car is in my possession.= The beautiful car is in the possession of me.</p>

<p>-- I am in possession of the beautiful car.（in possession of&hellip; 做表语）</p>

<p>take possession of&hellip; 拥有&hellip;</p>
<p>The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught.</p>
<p>Went on = lasted （last vi.继续, 持续）</p>
<p>It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.</p>
<p>It is disturbing to think that... 一想到&hellip;就心理不安</p>
<p>-- It is disturbing to think that I fail my examination</p>
<p>in the quiet countryside 在宁静的山村</p>

<p>3.Whom did you receive a letter from?</p>
<p>特殊疑问句中whom 不能省略（本句）。</p>
<p>定语从句中Which以及指代人的做宾语的Whom, 在非正式用法当中可以省略。</p>
<p>省略时，介词不能前置到关系代词Whom, Which前，只能用于非固定的动词短语后面。</p>
<p>固定的动词短语</p>
<p>look for：寻找（去掉for后look没有寻找的意思，所以介词for不能前置）</p>
<p>非固定的动词短语</p>
<p>look at：注视</p>
<p>live in：居住（去掉in后live仍有居住的意思，所以介词in可以前置）</p>

<p>5.Where is the pencil you were playing with?</p>
