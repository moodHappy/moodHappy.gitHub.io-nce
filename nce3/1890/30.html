<p>They employed a few farmhands, but no one was willing to work there long.</p>

<p>大家都去参加了葬礼，因为那&ldquo;鬼&rdquo;不是别人，正是农场主的兄弟埃里克.考科斯。人们以为埃里克年轻时就死了。</p>
<p>After the funeral, Joe and Bob revealed a secret which they had kept for over 50 years.</p>

<p>但他俩连自己的妻子都没告诉。</p>
<p>When their father died they thought it their duty to keep Eric in hiding.</p>
<p>父亲死后，他们兄弟俩认为有责任继续把埃里克藏起来。</p>
<p>All these years, Eric had lived as a recluse.</p>

<p>He used to sleep during the day and work at night, quite unaware of the fact that he had become the ghost of Endley.</p>
