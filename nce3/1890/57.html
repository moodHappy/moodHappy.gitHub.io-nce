<p>Lesson57 Back in the old country</p>
<p>Book</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>I stopped to let the car cool off and to study the map.</p>
<p>我停下车，让汽车发动机冷却一下，同时查看一下地图。</p>
<p>I had expected to be near my objective by now, but everything still seemed alien to me.</p>
<p>我本想离目的地已经不远，但周围一切对我仍很陌生。</p>
<p>I was only five when my father had taken me abroad, and that was 18 years ago.</p>
<p>我5岁那年，父亲就带我出了国，那是18年前的事了。</p>
<p>When my mother had died after a tragic accident, he did not quickly recover from the shock and loneliness.</p>
<p>当时我母亲在一次事故中惨死，父亲未能很快从悲痛与孤独中恢复过来。</p>
<p>Everything around him was full of her presence, continually reopening the wound.</p>
<p>他身边的一切都是母亲的影子不断勾起他的伤感。</p>
<p>So he decided to emigrate.</p>
<p>于是他决定移居他国。</p>
<p>In the new country he became absorbed in making a new life for the two of us, so that he gradually ceased to grieve.</p>
<p>在这个新的国家里，父亲专心致志地为我们俩开创一种新的生活，慢慢地不伤心了。</p>
<p>He did not marry again and I was brought up without a woman's care; but I lacked for nothing, for he was both father and mother to me.</p>
<p>父亲没有再娶，因此，我在没有母亲的环境里长大成人。但我却什么都不缺，他既当父亲又当母亲。</p>
<p>He always meant to go back one day, but not to stay.</p>
<p>他总想将来回国看看，但却不愿长期住下去，</p>
<p>His roots and mine had become too firmly embedded in the new land.</p>
<p>因为他与我一样已经把根深深地扎在异国的土地上。</p>
<p>But he wanted to see the old folk again and to visit my mother's grave.</p>
<p>但是，他想看一看家乡父老乡亲，为我的母亲扫墓。</p>
<p>He became mortally ill a few months before we had planned to go and, when he knew that he was dying, he made me promise to go on my own.</p>
<p>就在他计划回国的前几个月，他突然身患绝症。他知道自己已奄奄一息，于是他要我答应一定单独回故乡一趟。</p>
<p>I hired a car the day after landing and bought a comprehensive book of maps, which I found most helpful on the cross-country journey, but which I did not think I should need on the last stage.</p>
<p>我下飞机后租了一辆车，并买了一本详尽的地图册，在乡间行车途中，我觉得它非常有用，但快到家了，我倒觉得它没什么用了。</p>
<p>It was not that I actually remembered anything at all. But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone after leaving the nearest town, so that I was positive I should recognize it as familiar territory.</p>
<p>这倒并非是我背熟了地图，而是父亲曾详细给我讲了，在过了离故乡最近的那个小镇后，在每一个路标处可见到些什么。因此，我相信这段路对我来说会是很熟悉的。</p>
<p>Well, I had been wrong, for I was now lost.</p>
<p>唉，实际我错了，我现在迷路了。</p>
<p>I looked at the map and then at the milometer.</p>
<p>我看了看地图，又查了一下里程表。</p>
<p>I had come ten miles since leaving the town and at this point, according to my father, I should be looking at farms and cottages in a valley, with the spire of the church of our village showing in the far distance.</p>
<p>从小镇出来，我走了10英里。照父亲的说法，我面前应是一个山谷，有农场与村舍，还可远远望见老家村子里的教堂的尖顶。</p>
<p>I could see no valley, no farms, no cottages and no church spire-only a lake.</p>
<p>可现在我却看不出山谷，看不见农舍，也看见教学尖顶，看见只是一片湖泊。</p>
<p>I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere.</p>
<p>我想一定是什么地方拐错了弯儿。</p>
<p>So I drove back to the town and began to retrace the route, taking frequent glances at the map.</p>
<p>于是我驾车返回小镇，重新按路线行驶。</p>
<p>I landed up at the same corner.</p>
<p>结果又来到刚才那个拐弯处。</p>
<p>The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map.</p>
<p>奇怪的是那个湖没有在地图上标出。</p>
<p>I felt as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country, as you sometimes do in dreams.</p>
<p>我感到自己就像平时作梦那样迷迷糊糊地闯进了恶梦境地。</p>
<p>And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me.</p>
<p>就像在恶梦里一样，见不到一个人可以帮助我。</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, as I was wondering what to do next, there appeared on the horizon a man on horseback, riding in my direction.</p>
<p>不过，我是幸运的，正当我走投无路之时，从天边出现一个骑马的人向我骑来。</p>
<p>I waited till he came near, then I asked him the way to our old village.</p>
<p>等他走近了，问他去老家的路。</p>
<p>He said that there was now no village.</p>
<p>他说那村子已经没有了。</p>
<p>I thought he must have misunderstood me, so I repeated its name.</p>
<p>我想他一定误解了我的意思，于是又说一遍村庄的名字。</p>
<p>This time he pointed to the lake.</p>
<p>这次他用手指了一下那个湖。</p>
<p>The village no longer existed because it had been submerged, and all the valley too.</p>
<p>村庄已不复存在，因为已经为水所淹，山谷也被水淹没了。</p>
<p>The lake was not a natural one, but a man-made reservoir.</p>
<p>这不是一个天然湖泊，是一座人工修建的水库。</p>

<p>知识点（1）Lesson24、42、48 定语从句</p>
<p>语法：定语从句并列</p>

<p>The past progressive is chiefly used for past actions which continued for some time but whose exact limits are not known.</p>
<p>2）. 【不在同一层次上的双重定语从句】；第一个定语从句修饰前面的名词或短语，第二个定语从句修饰&ldquo;名词或短语+第一个定语从句&rdquo; 两个定语从句之间没有并列连词连接。第一个定语从句的关系词（一般是关系代词作宾语） 可省略。Lesson24</p>
<p>The only person I know（修饰person） who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton（who...定语从句，修饰前面整个主句）, and he is very pound of the fact.</p>
<p>3）. 【嵌入式定语从句 (Embedded Attributive Clause) 】：既是先行词的后置定语，又是另一个分句结构的宾语。Lesson42、48</p>
<p>&hellip;, but which I did not think I should need on the last stage.</p>
<p>造句：她有一个养子，这个养子据她讲是个孤儿。</p>
<p>She has an adopted son who she says is an orphan.</p>
<p>造句：Aleko 突然得到了一只新的羊羔，这只羊羔他声称是买来的。</p>
<p>Aleko suddenly acquired a new lamb which he claimed was bought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave.</p>
<p>Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.</p>
<p>备注：嵌入式定语从句和插入语的区别；插入语去掉之后应对语法没有影响，也对句子含义也没影响</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just published an article which I don&rsquo;t think is interesting at all. （如果去掉&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think &rdquo;对句子含义有影响）</p>
<p>I met a man whom I thought was a lunatic. （如果去掉&ldquo;I thought&rdquo;对语法有影响）</p>
<p>It was not that I actually remembered anything at all. But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone after leaving the nearest town, so that I was positive I should recognize it as familiar territory.</p>
