<p>Book</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong.</p>
<p>我们大家都有过事事不顺心的日子。</p>
<p>A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to get out of control.</p>
<p>一天开始时，可能还不错，但突然间似乎一切都失去了控制。</p>
<p>What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment.</p>
<p>情况经常是这样的，许许多多的事情都偏偏赶在同一时刻出问题，</p>
<p>It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of reactions.</p>
<p>好像是一件无关紧要的小事引起了一连串的连锁反应。</p>
<p>Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time.</p>
<p>假设你在做饭，同时又在照看孩子。</p>
<p>The telephone rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen series of catastrophes.</p>
<p>这时电话铃响了。它预示着一连串意想不到的灾难的来临。</p>
<p>While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process.</p>
<p>就在你接电话时，孩子把桌布从桌子上扯下来，将家中最好的陶瓷餐具半数摔碎，同时也弄伤了他自己。</p>
<p>You hang up hurriedly and attend to baby, crockery, etc.</p>
<p>你急急忙忙挂上电话，赶去照看孩子和餐具。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt.</p>
<p>这时，饭又烧糊了。</p>
<p>As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.</p>
<p>好像这一切还不足以使你急得掉泪，你的丈夫接着回来了，事先没打招呼就带来3个客人吃饭。</p>
<p>Things can go wrong on a big scale as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney.</p>
<p>就像许多人最近在悉尼郊区帕拉马塔发现的那样，有时乱子会闹得很大。</p>
<p>During the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue.</p>
<p>一天傍晚交通最拥挤时，一辆汽车撞上前面一辆汽车，两个司机争吵起来。</p>
<p>The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner.</p>
<p>紧跟其后的一辆车上的司机碰巧是个初学者，</p>
<p>She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car.</p>
<p>她一惊之下突然把车停了下来。</p>
<p>This made the driver following her brake hard.</p>
<p>她这一停使得跟在后头的司机也来个急刹车。</p>
<p>His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake.</p>
<p>司机妻子正坐在他身边，手里托着块大蛋糕。</p>
<p>As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road.</p>
<p>她往前一冲，蛋糕从挡风玻璃飞了出去掉到马路上。此时，一辆卡车正好从后边开到那辆汽车边上，</p>
<p>Seeing a cake flying through the air, a lorry driver who was drawing up alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden.</p>
<p>司机看见一块蛋糕从天而降，紧急刹车。</p>
<p>The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of the vehicle and on to the road.</p>
<p>卡车上装着空啤酒瓶。成百只瓶子顺势从卡车后面滑出车外落在马路上。</p>
<p>This led to yet another angry argument.</p>
<p>这又引起一场唇枪舌剑的争吵。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind.</p>
<p>与此同时，后面的车辆排成了长龙，</p>
<p>It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again.</p>
<p>警察花了将近一个小时才使车辆又开起来。</p>
<p>In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles.</p>
<p>在这段时间里，卡车司机不得不清扫那几百只破瓶子。</p>
<p>Only two stray dogs benefited from all this confusion, for they greedily devoured what was left of the cake.</p>
<p>只有两只野狗从这一片混乱中得到好处，它们贪婪地吃掉了剩下的蛋糕。</p>
<p>It was just one of those days!</p>
<p>这就是事事不顺心的那么一天！</p>
