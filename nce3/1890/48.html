<p>Lesson48 The silent village</p>
<p>Book</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>In this much-travelled world, there are still thousands of places which are inaccessible to tourists.</p>
<p>在这个旅游频繁的世界上，仍有成千上万个游人足迹未至的地方。</p>
<p>We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable.</p>
<p>人们总是以为偏僻的地方的村民们热情好客。</p>
<p>But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers.</p>
<p>但是，那些不但与外国旅游者隔绝，而且与本国同胞隔绝的人们有可能对游客抱有敌意。</p>
<p>Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable -- as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans.</p>
<p>到真正偏僻的村庄去旅游并不是一件愉快的事情。我与妻子在一次周游巴尔干半岛时对此深有体会。</p>
<p>We had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity.</p>
<p>我们在一座小镇上逗留了几天，参观了附近的许多古老的教堂。</p>
<p>These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well.</p>
<p>这些教堂吸引大量游客，不仅是因为建筑风格奇特，而且还有大量保存完好的壁画。</p>
<p>On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town.</p>
<p>我们离开小镇的前一天，镇上来了几辆满载游客的公共汽车。</p>
<p>This was more than we could bear, so we decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside.</p>
<p>人多得使我们难以忍受，于是我们决定利用最后一天去乡间一游。</p>
<p>Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood.</p>
<p>我们走上了一条出镇的小路，穿过几块农田，来到一片茂密的树林。</p>
<p>We expected the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees.</p>
<p>我们原以为小路会到此突然终止。没想到它到树林中继续向前延伸。</p>
<p>We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream.</p>
<p>我们在树林中跋涉了两个多小时，到了一条深溪边。</p>
<p>We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream.</p>
<p>我们可以看到小路在深溪对岸继续向前伸展，但却不知如何越过这道深溪。</p>
<p>Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank.</p>
<p>突然，妻子发现岸边泊着一条小船，</p>
<p>In it there was a boatman fast asleep.</p>
<p>船上有一船夫在呼呼大睡。</p>
<p>We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side.</p>
<p>我们轻轻地把他唤醒，请他把我们摆渡过溪。</p>
<p>Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually persuaded him to take us.</p>
<p>一开始，他很不愿意，但经劝说，终于同意了。</p>
<p>The path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain.</p>
<p>顺着小路，我们来到一个座落在陡峭山坡上的小村庄。</p>
<p>The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses.</p>
<p>这儿有一条未经修筑的弯弯曲曲的道路，路两边排列着一些矮小的农舍。</p>
<p>Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks.</p>
<p>农舍全用灰色的土坯建成，因此，即使在晴朗的蓝天底下，村庄看上去也会令人感到难以亲近。</p>
<p>The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby.</p>
<p>村里似乎无人居住，唯一的生命迹象是附近田里一只面目可憎的黑山羊，用一截短绳拴在一棵树上。</p>
<p>Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch.</p>
<p>我们在田边一堵东倒西歪的篱笆墙上坐下来，打开几听沙丁鱼罐头，吃了一顿野外午餐。</p>
<p>All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm.</p>
<p>突然，我注意到妻子十分惊恐。</p>
<p>Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate.</p>
<p>我抬头一看，发现我们被一群衣衫褴褛的小孩团团围住了，他们在默不作声地看着我们吃饭。</p>
<p>We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless.</p>
<p>我们给他们东西吃，客客气气地同他们交谈，但他们却一动也不动。</p>
<p>I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers.</p>
<p>我认为这不过是他们在陌生人面前表现出的害羞。</p>
<p>When we later walked down the main street of the village, we were followed by a silent procession of children.</p>
<p>后来，我们在村里的主要街道上行走的时候，一队默不作声的孩子跟在我们后头。</p>
<p>The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life.</p>
<p>刚才还似乎空荡荡的村庄一下子活跃了起来，</p>
<p>Faces appeared at windows.</p>
<p>窗口露出了一张张面孔，</p>
<p>Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us.</p>
<p>只穿着衬衣的男人们站在屋子外面凶狠地盯着我们，</p>
<p>Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways.</p>
<p>披黑纱巾的老妇人站在门口偷偷地瞅着我们。</p>
<p>The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard.</p>
<p>最令人害怕的是到处没有一点声音。</p>
<p>There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors.</p>
<p>毫无疑问，我们的来访是不受欢迎的。</p>
<p>We needed no further warning.</p>
<p>我们不需要进一步的警告了。</p>
<p>Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.</p>
<p>便掉转身子，沿着那条主要街道加快步伐，快速地朝深溪边走去，希望船夫还在那儿等着我们。</p>

<p>Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable -- as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans.</p>
<p>语法分析:</p>
<p>Visits（主语） to really remote villages（介词短语当后置定语，修饰Visits） are seldom enjoyable ― as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans（as... 非限定性定语从句）.</p>
<p>知识点（1）Lesson33</p>
<p>语法：as 引导的非限定性定语从句与 which 引导的非限定性定语从句的区别。</p>
<p>1、as 作为关系代词指代整个主句，而 which 作为关系代词指代整个主句或先行词均可。</p>
<p>2、as 引导的非限定性定语从句位于主句前、中、后均可，而which 引导的非限定性定语从句不能位于主句之前。</p>
<p>As a poet points out, life is but a dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children, as is always the case, love their mother.</p>
<p>She became angry, as many could see.</p>
<p>3、as 引导的非限定性定语从句含有&ldquo;众所周知&rdquo;的意思，常译为&ldquo;正如&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;，而which 引导的非限定性定语从句则未必有这个意思。</p>
<p>The sun heats the earth, which makes it possible for plants to grow.（不能换成as，没有&ldquo;正如&rdquo;的含义）</p>
<p>4、在&ldquo;as + is/was + done&rdquo;结构中可省略&ldquo;is/was&rdquo;，而在 &ldquo;which + is/was + done&rdquo;可省略&ldquo;which + is/was&rdquo;，而不能只省略 be 动词。</p>
<p>As (is) reported, a foreign delegation will visit the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a puma (which was) at large&nbsp;</p>
<p>课文举例：</p>
<p>Things can go wrong on a big scale, as （关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做discovered的宾语） a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney.</p>
<p>As （关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做explained的宾语） the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!</p>
<p>If, as（关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做主语） has been reported, they have protected humans from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks.</p>
<p>As（关系代词，非限定性定语从句，关系代词做主语） is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil.</p>
<p>（第二段）</p>

<p>知识点（1）</p>
