<p>Lesson24 A skeleton in the cupboard</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret which has been concealed from strangers for years.</p>
<p>在小说中，我们经常读到一个表面上受人尊重的人物或家庭，却有着某种多年不为人所知的骇人听闻的秘密。</p>
<p>The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation.</p>
<p>英语中有一个生动的说法来形容这种情况。</p>
<p>The terrible secret is called 'a skeleton in the cupboard'.</p>
<p>惊人的秘密称作&ldquo;柜中骷髅&rdquo;。</p>
<p>At some dramatic moment in the story, the terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined.</p>
<p>在小说的某个戏剧性时刻，可怕的秘密泄漏出来，接着便是某人的声誉扫地。</p>
<p>The reader's hair stands on end when he reads in the final pages of the novel that the heroine, a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody, had, in her youth, poisoned every one of her five husbands.</p>
<p>当读者到小说最后几页了解到书中女主人公，那位一向待大家很好的可爱的老妇人年轻时一连毒死了她的5个丈夫时，不禁会毛骨悚然。</p>
<p>It is all very well for such things to occur in fiction.</p>
<p>这种事发生在小说中是无可非议的。</p>
<p>To varying degrees, we all have secrets which we do not want even our closest friends to learn, but few of us have skeletons in the cupboard.</p>
<p>尽管我们人人都有各种大小秘密。连最亲密的朋友都不愿让他们知道，但我们当中极少有人有柜中骷髅。</p>
<p>The only person I know who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton, and he is very proud of the fact.</p>
<p>我所认识的唯一的在柜中藏骷嵝的人便是乔治.卡尔顿，他甚至引以为自豪。</p>
<p>George studied medicine in his youth. Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories.</p>
<p>乔治年轻时学过医，然而，他后来没当上医生，却成了一位成功的侦探小说作家。</p>
<p>I once spent an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house.</p>
<p>有一次，我在他家里度周末，过得很不愉快。这事我永远不会忘记。</p>
<p>George showed me to the guestroom which, he said, was rarely used.</p>
<p>乔治把我领进客房，说这间很少使用。</p>
<p>He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner.</p>
<p>他让我打开行装后下楼吃饭。</p>
<p>After I had stacked my shirts and underclothes in two empty drawers, I decided to hang one of the two suits I had brought with me in the cupboard.</p>
<p>我将衬衫、内衣放进两个空抽屉里，然后我想把随身带来的两套西服中的一套挂到大衣柜里去。</p>
<p>I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it petrified.</p>
<p>我打开柜门，站在柜门前一下惊呆了。</p>
<p>A skeleton was dangling before my eyes.</p>
<p>一具骷髅悬挂在眼前，</p>
<p>The sudden movement of the door made it sway slightly and it gave me the impression that it was about to leap out at me.</p>
<p>由于柜门突然打开，它也随之轻微摇晃起来，让我觉得它好像马上要跳出柜门朝我扑过来似的。</p>
<p>Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George.</p>
<p>我扔下西服冲下楼去告诉乔治。</p>
<p>This was worse than 'a terrible secret'; this was a real skeleton!</p>
<p>这是比&ldquo;骇人听闻的秘密&rdquo;更加惊人的东西，这是一具真正的骷髅啊！</p>
<p>But George was unsympathetic. 'Oh, that,' he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old friend.</p>
<p>但乔治却无动于衷。&ldquo;噢，是它呀！他笑着说道，俨然在谈论一位老朋友。</p>
