<p>Lesson12 Life on a desert island</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island.</p>
<p>我们许多人对于荒岛生活有一种不切实际的想法。</p>
<p>We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines.</p>
<p>我们有时想象荒岛是阳光终日普照的天堂。</p>
<p>Life there is simple and good.</p>
<p>在那里，生活简单又美好。</p>
<p>Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work.</p>
<p>成熟的水果从树上掉下来，人们根本无需劳动。</p>
<p>The other side of the picture is quite the opposite.</p>
<p>另一种想法恰恰相反，</p>
<p>Life on a desert island is wretched.</p>
<p>认为荒岛生活很可怕，</p>
<p>You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes.</p>
<p>要么饿死，要么像鲁滨孙那样，天天盼船来，却总没见船影。</p>
<p>Perhaps there is an element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity to find out.</p>
<p>也许，这两种都像都有可信之处。但很少有人能有机会去弄个究竟。</p>

<p>他们迅速把食物、火柴、罐装啤酒往一只救生筏上装。然后在加勒比海上划行了几英里，到了一座珊瑚岛上。</p>
<p>There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem.</p>
<p>岛上几乎没有一颗树，也没有淡水，但这不算什么问题。</p>
<p>The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy.</p>
<p>他们用像皮艇蓄积雨水。</p>
<p>As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat.</p>
<p>由于他们随身带了一支捕鱼枪，因此，吃饭不愁。</p>
<p>They caught lobster and fish every day, and as one of them put it 'ate like kings'.</p>
<p>他们天天捕捉龙虾和鱼，正如其中一位所说，吃得&ldquo;像国王一样好&rdquo;。</p>
<p>When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.</p>
