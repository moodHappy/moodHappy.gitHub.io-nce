<p>Book</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>The rough road across the plain soon became so bad that we tried to get Bruce to drive back to the village we had come from.</p>
<p>穿越平原的道路高低不平，开车走了不远，路面愈加崎岖。我们想劝说布鲁斯把车开回我们出发的那个村庄去。</p>
<p>Even though the road was littered with boulders and pitted with holes, Bruce was not in the least perturbed.</p>
<p>尽管路面布满石头，坑坑洼洼，但布鲁斯却一点儿不慌乱。</p>
<p>Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere 20 miles away.</p>
<p>他瞥了一眼地图，告诉我们前面再走不到20英里就是一个村庄。</p>
<p>It was not that Bruce always underestimated difficulties. He simply had no sense of danger at all.</p>
<p>这并不是说布鲁斯总是低估困难，而是他压根儿没有一点儿危险感。</p>
<p>No matter what the conditions were, he believed that a car should be driven as fast as it could possibly go.</p>
<p>他认为不管路面情况如何，车必须以最高速度前进。</p>
<p>As we bumped over the dusty track, we swerved to avoid large boulders.</p>
<p>我们在尘士飞扬的道路上颠簸，车子东拐西弯，以躲开那些大圆石。</p>
<p>The wheels scooped up stones which hammered ominously under the car.</p>
<p>车轮搅起的石块锤击车身，发出不祥的锤击声。</p>
<p>We felt sure that sooner or later a stone would rip a hole in our petrol tank or damage the engine.</p>
<p>我们想念迟早会飞起一个石块把油箱砸开一个窟窿，或者把发动机砸坏。</p>
<p>Because of this, we kept looking back, wondering if we were leaving a trail of oil and petrol behind us.</p>
<p>因此，我们不时地掉过头，怀疑车后是否留下了机油和汽油的痕迹。</p>
<p>What a relief it was when the boulders suddenly disappeared, giving way to a stretch of plain where the only obstacles were clumps bushes.</p>
<p>突然大石块不见了，前面是一片平地，唯一的障碍只有一簇簇灌木丛。这使我们长长地松了口气。</p>
<p>But there was worse to come. Just ahead of us there was a huge fissure.</p>
<p>但是更糟糕的事情在等着我们，离我们不远处，出现一个大裂缝。</p>
<p>In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped.</p>
<p>我们再次央求布鲁斯小心，他这才把车停了下来。</p>
<p>Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car.</p>
<p>我们纷纷下车察看那个大裂缝，他却呆在车上。</p>
<p>We informed him that the fissure extended for 50 yards and was two feet wide and four feet deep.</p>
<p>我们告诉他那个大裂缝长50码，宽2英尺，深4英尺。</p>
<p>Even this had no effect.</p>
<p>这也没有对他产生任何影响。</p>
<p>Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed, keeping the front wheels astride the crack as he followed its zigzag course.</p>
<p>布鲁斯挂上慢档，把两只前轮分别搁在裂缝的两边，顺着弯弯曲曲的裂缝，以发疯的速度向前开去。</p>
<p>Before we had time to worry about what might happen, we were back on the plain again.</p>
<p>我们还未来得及担心后果，车已重新开上了平地。</p>
<p>Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only 15 miles away.</p>
<p>布鲁斯又看了一眼地图，告诉我们那座村庄离我们只有15英里了。</p>
<p>Our next obstacle was a shallow pool of water about half a mile across.</p>
<p>下一个障碍是一片约半英里宽的浅水塘。</p>
<p>Bruce charged at it, but in the middle, the car came to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>布鲁斯向水塘冲去，但车开到水塘当中，嘎吱一声停住了。</p>
<p>A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine!</p>
<p>仪表盘一盏黄灯闪着刺眼的光芒，布鲁斯兴致勃勃地宣布发动机里没油了！</p>
