<p>课文</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have learnt to expect that trains will be punctual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我们已经习惯于相信火车总是准点的。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After years of conditioning, most of us have developed an unshakable faith in railway timetables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>经过多年的适应，大多数人对火车时刻表产生了一种不可动摇的信念。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ships may be delayed by storms; flights may be cancelled because of bad weather; but trains must be on time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>轮船船期可能因风暴而推延，飞机航班可能因恶劣天气而取消，唯有火车必然是准点的。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only an exceptionally heavy snow fall might temporarily dislocate railway services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>只有非同寻常的大雪才可能暂时打乱铁路运行。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is all too easy to blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>因此，一旦铁路上真出了问题，人们便不加思索地责备铁路当局。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>事实上，差错很可能是我们自己，而不是铁路当局的。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After consulting my railway timetable, I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我查看了列车时刻表，满意地了解到有一趟去威斯特海温的快车。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted a mere hour and 17 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>这是趟直达车，旅途总共才需1小时17分钟。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I boarded the train, I could not help noticing that a great many local people got on as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>上车后，我不禁注意到许多当地人也上了车。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, this did not strike me as odd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>一开始，我并不感到奇怪，</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reflected that there must be a great many people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我想除我之外，想利用快车之便的也一定大有人在。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither was I surprised when the train stopped at Widley, a tiny station a few miles along the line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>火车开出几英里即在一个小站威德里停了下来。对此，我不觉得奇怪，</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>因为即便是特别快车也可能被信号拦住。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>但是，当火车一站接着一站往前蠕动时，我便产生了怀疑。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It suddenly dawned on me that this express was not roaring down the line at 90 miles an hour, but barely chugging along at 30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我突然感到这趟快车并没以时速90英里的速度呼啸前进，而是卟哧卟哧地向前爬行，时速仅30英里。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One hour and 17 minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1小时17分过去了，走了还不到一半路程。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express, but he had not even heard of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我问一位乘客，这是不是开往威斯特海温的那趟快车，他说从未听说过有这么一趟快车。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I determined to lodge a complaint as soon as we arrived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我决定到目的地就给铁路部门提意见。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>两小时后，我气呼呼地同威斯特海温站站长说起此事。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>他说根本没有这趟车。于是我借他本人的列车时刻表，</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a note of triumph in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我带着一种胜利者的调子告诉他那趟车白纸黑字。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>明明白白印在时刻表上。他迅速地扫视了一眼，让我再看一遍。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>一个小小的星形符号把我的目光引到了那页底部一个说明上。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It said: 'This service has been suspended.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>上面写着：&ldquo;此趟列车暂停运行。&rdquo;</p>
