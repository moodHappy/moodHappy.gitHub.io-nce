<p>课文</p>
<p>Antique shops exert a peculiar fascination on a great many people.</p>
<p>古玩店对许多人来说有一种特殊的魅力。</p>
<p>The more expensive kind of antique shop where rare objects are beautifully displayed in glass cases to keep them free from dust is usually a forbidding place.</p>
<p>高档一点的古玩店为了防尘，把文物漂亮地陈列在玻璃柜子里，那里往往令人望而却步。</p>
<p>But no one has to muster up courage to enter a less pretentious antique shop.</p>
<p>而对不太装腔作势的古玩店，无论是谁都不用壮着胆子才敢往里进。</p>

<p>Like a scientist bent on making a discovery, he must cherish the hope that one day he will be amply rewarded.</p>

<p>Frank gently lifted the crockery out of the box and suddenly noticed a miniature painting at the bottom of the packing case.</p>
<p>弗兰克轻轻地把陶器拿出箱子，突然发现在箱底有一幅微型画，</p>
<p>As its composition and line reminded him of an Italian painting he knew well, he decided to buy it.</p>
<p>画面构图与纸条使他想起一幅他所熟悉的意大利画，于是他决定将画买了下来。</p>
<p>Glancing at it briefly the dealer told him that it was worth ￡50.</p>

<p>Frank could hardly conceal his excitement, for he knew that he had made a real discovery.</p>
