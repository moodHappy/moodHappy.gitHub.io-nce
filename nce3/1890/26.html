<p>No one can avoid being influenced by advertisements.</p>
<p>没有人能避免受广告的影响。</p>
<p>Much as we may pride ourselves on our good taste, we are no longer free to choose the things we want, for advertising exerts a subtle influence on us.</p>
<p>尽管我们可以自夸自己的鉴赏力如何敏锐，但我们已经无法独立自主地选购自己所需的东西了，这是因为广告在我们身上施加着一种潜移默化的影响。</p>
<p>In their efforts to persuade us to buy this or that product, advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.</p>
<p>做广告的人在力图劝说我们买下这种产品或那种产品之前，已经仔细地研究了人的本性，并把人的弱点进行了分类。</p>
<p>Advertisers discovered years ago that all of us love to get something for nothing.</p>
<p>做广告的人们多年前就发现我们大家都喜欢免费得到东西。</p>
<p>An advertisement which begins with the magic word FREE can rarely go wrong.</p>
<p>凡是用&ldquo;免费&rdquo;这个神奇的词开头的广告很少会失败的。</p>
<p>These days, advertisers not only offer free samples, but free cars, free houses, and free trips round the world as well.</p>
<p>目前，做广告的人不仅提供免费样品，而且还提供免费汽车，免费住房，免费周游世界。</p>

<p>Radio and television have made it possible for advertisers to capture the attention of millions of people in this way.</p>

<p>The largest was 713 pounds. It seemed certain that this would win the prize.</p>
<p>最重的一个达713磅，看来这个饼干获奖无疑了。</p>
<p>But just before the competition closed, a lorry arrived at the factory with a truly colossal biscuit which weighed 2,400 pounds.</p>
<p>但就在竞赛截止时间将到之际，一辆卡车驶进了工厂，运来了一个特大无比、重达2,400磅的饼干。</p>
<p>It had been baked by a college student who had used over 1,000 pounds of flour, 800 pounds of sugar, Two hundred pounds of fat, and four hundred pounds of various other ingredients. It was so heavy that a crane had to be used to remove it from the lorry.</p>
<p>它是由一个大学生烘制的，用去1,000多磅的面粉、800磅食糖、200磅动物脂肪及400磅其他各种原料。饼干份量太重了，用了一台起重机才把它从卡车上卸下。</p>
<p>The manufacturers had to pay more money than they had anticipated, for they bought the biscuit from the student for $24,000.</p>
<p>饼干公司不得不付出比他们预计多得多的钱，因为为买下那学生烘制的饼干他们支付了24,000美元。</p>
