<p>Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics.</p>
<p>Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic.</p>
<p>When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it.</p>

<p>The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.</p>
<p>The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them. Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press.</p>
<p>He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply.</p>
<p>He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired.</p>
<p>When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written.</p>

<p>编辑立即给那位记者发去传真，要求他核实一下台阶的确切数字和围墙的高度。</p>
<p>记者立即出发去核实这些重要的事实，但过了好长时间不见他把数字寄来，在此期间，编辑等得不耐烦了，因为杂志马上要付印。</p>
<p>他给记者先后发去两份传真，但对方毫无反应。</p>
<p>于是他又发了一份传真，通知那位记者说，若再不迅速答复，将被解雇。</p>
<p>但记者还是没有回复。编辑无奈，勉强按原样发稿了。</p>
<p>一周之后，编辑终于接到记者的传真。</p>
