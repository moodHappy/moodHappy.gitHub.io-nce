<p>Up to the time of his death, Richard Colson was one of the most notable figures in our town.</p>

<p>He was a shrewd and wealthy businessman, but most people in the town hardly knew anything about this side of his life.</p>
<p>他是个精明能干、有钱的商人，但镇上大部分人对他生活中的这一个方面几乎一无所知。</p>
<p>He was known to us all as Dickie and his eccentricity had become legendary long before he died.</p>

<p>One day, he walked into an expensive shop after having been caught in a particularly heavy shower.</p>

<p>The assistant asked him to leave, but Dickie paid no attention to him and requested to see the manager.</p>
<p>店员让迪基走开，他置之不理，并要求见经理。</p>
<p>Recognizing who the customer was, the manager was most apologetic and reprimanded the assistant severely.</p>
<p>经理认出了这位顾客，表示了深深的歉意，还严厉地训斥了店员。</p>
<p>When Dickie was given the watch, he presented the assistant with the cloth bag.</p>

<p>It contained ￡300 in pennies.</p>

<p>他坚持要店员点清那些硬币后他才离去。这些硬币加在一起共有30,000枚！</p>
<p>On another occasion, he invited a number of important critics to see his private collection of modern paintings.</p>
<p>还有一次，他邀请一些著名评论家来参观他私人收藏的现代画。</p>
<p>This exhibition received a great deal of attention in the press, for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists, they had in fact been painted by Dickie.</p>
<p>这次展览引起报界广泛注意，因为这些画名义上是名家的作品，事实上是迪基自己画的。</p>
<p>It took him four years to stage this elaborate joke simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>他花了4年时间策划这出精心设计的闹剧，只是想证明评论家们有时并不解他们所谈论的事情。</p>
