<p>语法：指轮船前加定冠词 &ldquo;the&rdquo;</p>
<p>the Cutty Sark</p>
<p>the Vasa</p>
<p>语法：同位语前的定冠词&ldquo;the&rdquo;可以省略</p>

<p>One of the most famous sailing ships of the nineteenth century, the Cutty Sark(同位语，the没省略), can still be seen at Greenwich.</p>
<p>语法：介词变化：从某个地方驶向某个地方 </p>

<p>语法：全部倒装（把全部谓语置于主语之前。）</p>
<p>表示位置或次序的状语置于句首，只要满足两个条件，要用全部倒装。</p>
<p>主语不是代词。</p>
<p>谓语动词不是及物动词。</p>
<p>这种倒装主要目的是为了突出句末的主语。</p>
<p>In came Miss Green.</p>
<p>On the hill stands a temple. </p>
<p>There are two people.</p>
<p>There once stood a little village. </p>
<p>Now comes your turn.</p>

<p>Off he went. 主语不能是代词</p>
<p>On the hill John saw Mary. 谓语是及物动词</p>
<p>表语置于句首。这种倒装主要目的是为了避免头重脚轻（主语较长）。</p>

<p>Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay.</p>
<p>语法：部分倒装 只把助动词，be 动词(之前没有其他助动词)或情态动词置于主语之前。</p>

<p>2、&ldquo;only + 状语&rdquo; 位于句首</p>
<p>3、such, so, well, often, many a time 等表示程度、频率的副词位于句首</p>
<p>语法：部分倒装和全部倒装的区别。</p>
<p>1、部分倒装是为了突出句首；完全倒装是为了突出句尾（表语前置引起的完全倒装多是为了避免头重脚轻）。</p>
<p>2、部分倒装只看句首，对主语谓语没有要求；全部倒装对主语谓语有要求（表语前置引起的完全倒装除外）。</p>
