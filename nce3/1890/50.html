<p>Lesson50 New Year resolutions</p>
<p>Book</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>The New Year is a time for resolutions.</p>
<p>新年是下决心的时候，</p>
<p>Mentally, at least, most of us could compile formidable lists of 'dos' and 'don'ts'.</p>
<p>至少在大多数人的心里会编排出一份&ldquo;应做什么&rdquo;和&ldquo;不应做什么&rdquo;的令人生畏的单子。</p>
<p>The same old favourites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity.</p>
<p>相同的决心以单调的规律年复一年地出现。</p>
<p>We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don't like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day.</p>
<p>我们决心每天早晨起得早些；吃得少些；多花点时间与孩子们一起做游戏；做大量的家务；对不喜欢的人友善一些；小心驾车；每天都要带着狗散步；等等。</p>
<p>Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment.</p>
<p>以往的经验告诉我们有些事是办不到的。</p>
<p>If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure.</p>
<p>如果我们烟瘾大，戒不掉，那是因为屡戒屡败，失去信心。</p>
<p>Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out.</p>
<p>我们大多数人想自我完善却遭到失败，这是因为我们的规划过于宏大，而又根本没有时间去实施。</p>
<p>We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways.</p>
<p>我们还犯有一个根本性的错误，即把我们的决心向大家宣布。这样一旦滑回到那些老习惯上去，我们在别人的眼里会显得更加难堪。</p>
<p>Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself.</p>
<p>我深知这些问题，于是，今年我对自己的计划要严加保密，</p>
<p>I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercises every morning and to read more of an evening.</p>
<p>只给自己定下两项适中的任务；每天早上锻炼身体，每天晚上多看点书。</p>
<p>An all-night party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.</p>
<p>新年除夕举办的一次通宵晚会，使我理直气壮地在新年头一天免去了这两项任务。不过，新年第二天，我全力以赴地照着去做了。</p>
<p>The daily exercises lasted only 11 minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up.</p>
<p>早锻炼一共只有11分钟，我打算在别人起床之前进行。</p>
<p>The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed 11 minutes earlier than usual was considerable.</p>
<p>这就要求我比平时早11分钟把自己从床上拽起来，这种自我约束是很艰苦的。</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out.</p>
<p>不过开头两天我还是成功地蹑手蹑脚地来到楼下起居室，被谁也没发现。</p>
<p>After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition.</p>
<p>我在地毯上跳来蹦过去，扭曲身子，摆出各种姿势，弄得浑身不舒服，然后坐到桌边吃早饭，一副筋疲力尽的样子。</p>
<p>It was this that betrayed me.</p>
<p>正是这副模样泄露了我的秘密。</p>
<p>The next morning the whole family trooped in to watch the performance.</p>
<p>第二天早晨全家人结队来到起居室看我表演。</p>
<p>That was really unsettling but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea.</p>
<p>这真叫人不好意思，但我心平气和地顶住全家人的嘲笑和奚落。不久，大家对我习以为常了，</p>
<p>However, my enthusiasm waned.</p>
<p>而这时我的热情却减退了。</p>
<p>The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished.</p>
<p>我花在锻炼上的时间逐渐减少，</p>
<p>Little by little the 11 minutes fell to zero.</p>
<p>慢慢地从11分钟减到了零。</p>
<p>By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from.</p>
<p>到了1月10日，我恢复了原来的作息时间。</p>
<p>I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home from work.</p>
<p>我辩解说，早晨少耗费精力锻炼，晚上下班回家看书时头脑更清醒些。</p>
<p>Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to a book.</p>
<p>有几天晚上，我极力摆脱了电视的诱惑，坐在自己的房间里，两眼盯在书上。</p>
<p>One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read.</p>
<p>可是，有一天夜里，我感到又冷又孤单，便来到楼下坐在电视机前假装看书。</p>
<p>That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen.</p>
<p>这下我可完了，因为不一会儿，我就恢复了以前的坏习惯，在屏幕前打起瞌睡来。</p>
<p>I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading.</p>
<p>但我还没有放弃多看些书的决心。</p>
<p>In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute.</p>
<p>事实上，我刚买来一本叫《一分钟读一千字的诀窍》的书。</p>
<p>Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it!</p>
<p>也许这本书能解决我的问题，但我一直还没时间去看这本书！</p>
