<p>Lesson59 Collecting</p>
<p>Book</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>People tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so.</p>
<p>人们喜欢收藏东西，有时并没有意识到自己在这样做。</p>
<p>Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned.</p>
<p>确实，一旦无意之中从自己的收藏品中找到某件有用的东西时，可以给人一种惊喜的感觉。</p>
<p>Those who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter.</p>
<p>那些从来不必搬家的人们成了一种无所无容的收藏家。</p>
<p>They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things.</p>
<p>他们专门收藏那些只能被称作杂货的东西。他们在抽屉里，碗柜中、阁楼上堆放着一些不用的东西，一放就是好几年，</p>
<p>As they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment.</p>
<p>相信总有一天需要的正好是那些东西。人们年老之后也喜欢收藏东西，不过是出于两个不同的原因：一是体力，精力均告不佳，这二者是清除无用的东西必不可少的因素；另一原因是感情因素。</p>
<p>Things owned for a long time are full of associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.</p>
<p>东西搁得时间久了，便会充满着与过去岁月的联系，比方说与死去的亲戚有关。因此这些东西慢慢获得了一种超出它本身的价值。</p>
<p>Some things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste.</p>
<p>居家度日，有目的地收藏某些东西是为了防止浪费。</p>
<p>Among these I would list string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two requisites.</p>
<p>这些东西中我想举出线绳和包装纸为例，节俭的人们打开包裹后便把这两样必备的东西收藏起来。省得日后去买。</p>
<p>Collecting small items can easily become a mania.</p>
<p>收集小玩艺儿很容易着迷。</p>
<p>I know someone who always cuts sketches out from newspapers of model clothes that she would like to buy if she had the money.</p>
<p>我认识一个人，她总喜欢从报纸上剪下流行服装的图样，等以后有钱时去买服装。</p>
<p>As she is not rich, the chances that she will ever be able to afford such purchases are remote; but she is never sufficiently strongminded to be able to stop the practice.</p>
<p>由于她并不富裕，她买得起这些服装的可能性十分渺茫，但她又缺乏足够坚强的意志把这一收集活动停下来。</p>
<p>It is a harmless habit, but it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it, loose bits of paper fall out in every direction.</p>
<p>这种习惯无害，只把写字台里堆得满满当当，以致每次打开抽屉总能带出许多纸片四处飞扬。</p>
<p>Collecting as a serious hobby is quite different and has many advantages.</p>
<p>作为一种严肃的业余爱好的收藏活动完全是另外一回事，</p>
<p>It provides relaxation for leisure hours, as just looking at one's treasures is always a joy.</p>
<p>它具有许多益处，它可以使人在闲暇中得到休息，因为欣赏自己收藏的珍品总会充满了乐趣。</p>
<p>One does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home.</p>
<p>人们不必走到户外去寻求娱乐，因为收藏品都是存放在家中。</p>
<p>Whatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books, china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books.</p>
<p>不管收藏品是什么，邮票、唱片、头版书籍、瓷器、玻璃杯、老式家具、绘画、模型汽车、鸟类标本，还是玩具动物，从为新增添的收藏品寻找摆放位置到核对参考书中的事实，总归有事可做。</p>
<p>This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, but also in general matters which have some bearing on it.</p>
<p>这种爱好不仅能使人从选择的专题中受到教育，而且也能从与之有关的一般事物中获得长进。</p>
<p>There are also other benefits.</p>
<p>除此之外，还有其他的益处。</p>
<p>One wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to exchange articles, to show off the latest find.</p>
<p>收藏者要会见情趣相投的收藏者，以获取教益，交流经验、交换收藏品，炫耀自己的最新收藏。</p>
<p>So one's circle of friends grows.</p>
<p>朋友的圈子就这样不断扩大。</p>
<p>Soon the hobby leads to travel, perhaps to a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to any one country.</p>
<p>用不了多久，有这种爱好的人便开始旅行，也许是去另一个城市参加会议，也可能是出国寻找一件珍品，因为收藏家是不分国籍的。</p>
<p>Over the years, one may well become an authority on one's hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences.</p>
<p>一人积了多年经验会成为自己这种爱好的权威，很可能应邀在小型集会上作非正式的讲话。如果讲得好，可能向更多人发表演说。</p>
<p>In this way self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to talk about it.</p>
<p>这样，你自信心不断增强，先是因为掌握一门学问，接下来是因为能够就此发表见解。</p>
<p>Collecting, by occupying spare time so constructively, makes a person contented, with no time for boredom.</p>
<p>收藏活动通过富有建设性地利用业余时间使人感到心满意足，不再有无聊之日。</p>
