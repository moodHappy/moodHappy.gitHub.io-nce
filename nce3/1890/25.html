<p>Lesson25 The Cutty Sark</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>One of the most famous sailing ships of the 19th century, the Cutty Sark, can still be seen at Greenwich.</p>
<p>人们在格林威治仍可看到19世纪最有名的帆船之一&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&rdquo;号。</p>
<p>She stands on dry land and is visited by thousands of people each year.</p>
<p>它停在陆地上，每年接待成千上万的参观者。</p>
<p>She serves as an impressive reminder of the great ships of the past.</p>
<p>它给人们留下深刻的印象，使人们回忆起历史上的巨型帆船，</p>
<p>Before they were replaced by steamships, sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to carry tea from China and wool from Australia.</p>
<p>在蒸汽船取代帆船之前。&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&rdquo;号之类的帆船被用来从中国运回茶叶，从澳大利亚运回羊毛。</p>
<p>The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.</p>
<p>&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&rdquo;号是帆船制造史上建造的最快的一艘帆船。</p>
<p>The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.</p>
<p>唯一可以与之一比高低的是&ldquo;塞姆皮雷&rdquo;号帆船。</p>
<p>Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England.</p>
<p>两船于1872年6月18日同时从上海启航驶往英国，途中展开了一场激烈的比赛。</p>
<p>This race, which went on for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.</p>
<p>这场比赛持续了整整4个月，是这类比赛中的最后一次，</p>
<p>It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.</p>
<p>它标志着帆船伟大传统的结束与一个新纪元的开始。</p>
<p>The first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae, but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took the lead.</p>
<p>比赛开始后，&ldquo;赛姆皮雷&rdquo;号率先抵达爪哇岛。但在印度洋上，&ldquo;卡萨萨克&rdquo;号驶到了前面。</p>
<p>It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home, but during the race she had a lot of bad luck.</p>
<p>看来，它首先返抵英国是确信无疑的了，但它却在比赛中连遭厄运。</p>
<p>In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away.</p>
<p>8月份&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&rdquo;号遭到一场特大风暴的袭击，失去了一只舵。</p>
<p>The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her.</p>
<p>船身左右摇晃，无法操纵。</p>
<p>A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty.</p>
<p>船员用备用的木板在船上赶制了一只应急用的舵，并克服重重困难将舵安装就位，</p>
<p>This greatly reduced the speed of the ship, for there was a danger that if she travelled too quickly, this rudder would be torn away as well.</p>
<p>这样一来，大大降低了船的航速。因为船不能开得太快，否则就有危险，应急舵也会被刮走。</p>
<p>Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead.</p>
<p>因为这个缘故，&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&rdquo;号落到了后面。</p>
<p>After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted, but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>跨越赤道后，船长将船停靠在一个港口，在那儿换了一只舵。但此时，&ldquo;赛姆皮雷&rdquo;号早已在500多英里之遥了。</p>
<p>Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win.</p>
<p>尽管换装新舵时分秒必争，但&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&rdquo;号已经不可能取胜了，</p>
<p>She arrived in England a week after the Thermopylae. Even this was remarkable, considering that she had had so many delays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>它抵达英国时比&ldquo;塞姆皮雷&rdquo;号晚了1个星期。但考虑到路上的多次耽搁，这个成绩也已很不容易了。</p>
<p>There is no doubt that if she had not lost her rudder she would have won the race easily.</p>
<p>毫无疑问，如果中途没有失去舵， &ldquo;卡帝萨克&rdquo;号肯定能在比赛中轻易夺冠。</p>
