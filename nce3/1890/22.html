<p>课文</p>
<p>Some plays are so successful that they run for years on end.</p>
<p>有些剧目十分成功，以致连续上演好几年。</p>
<p>In many ways, this is unfortunate for the poor actors who are required to go on repeating the same lines night after night.</p>
<p>这样一来，可怜的演员们可倒霉了。因为他们需要一夜连着一夜地重复同样的台词。</p>
<p>One would expect them to know their parts by heart and never have cause to falter.</p>
<p>人们以为，这些演员一定会把台词背得烂熟，绝不会临场结巴的，</p>
<p>Yet this is not always the case.</p>
<p>但情况却并不总是这样。</p>
<p>A famous actor in a highly successful play was once cast in the role of an aristocrat who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for 20 years.</p>
<p>有一位名演员曾在一出极为成功的剧目中扮演一个贵族角色，这个贵族已在巴士底狱被关押了20年。</p>
<p>In the last act, a gaoler would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner.</p>
<p>在最后一幕中，狱卒手持一封信上场，然后将信交给狱中那位贵族。</p>
<p>Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance, he always insisted that it should be written out in full.</p>
<p>尽管那个贵族每场戏都得念一遍那封信。但他还是坚持要求将信的全文写在信纸上。</p>
<p>One night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleague to find out if, after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart.</p>
<p>一天晚上，狱卒决定与他的同事开一个玩笑，看看他反复演出这么多场之后，是否已将信的内容记熟了。</p>
<p>The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.</p>
<p>大幕拉开，最后一幕戏开演，贵族独自一人坐在铁窗后阴暗的牢房里。</p>
<p>Just then, the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his hands.</p>
<p>这时狱卒上场，手里拿着那封珍贵的信。</p>
<p>He entered the cell and presented the letter to the aristocrat.</p>
<p>狱卒走进牢房，将信交给贵族。</p>
<p>But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual.</p>
<p>但这回狱卒给贵族的信没有像往常那样把全文写全，</p>
<p>It was simply a blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p>而是一张白纸。</p>
<p>The gaoler looked on eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines.</p>
<p>狱卒热切地观察着，急于想了解他的同事是否记熟了台词。</p>
<p>The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.</p>
<p>贵族盯着纸看了几秒钟，</p>
<p>Then, squinting his eyes, he said: 'The light is dim. Read the letter to me.'</p>
<p>然后眯起眼睛，说道：&ldquo;光线太暗，请给我读一下这封信。&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler.</p>
<p>说完，他一下子把信递给狱卒。</p>
<p>Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either,</p>
<p>狱卒发现自己连一个字也记不住，</p>
<p>the gaoler replied: 'The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses.'</p>
<p>于是便说：&ldquo;陛下，这儿光线的确太暗了，我得去眼镜拿来。&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, he hurried off the stage.</p>
<p>他一边说着，一边匆匆下台。</p>
<p>Much to the aristocrat's amusement, the gaoler returned a few moments later with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter which he proceeded to read to the prisoner.</p>
<p>贵族感到非常好笑的是：一会儿工夫，狱卒重新登台，拿来一副眼镜以及平时使用的那封信，然后为那囚犯念了起来。</p>
