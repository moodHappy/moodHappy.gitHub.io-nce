<p>Book</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>Insurance companies are normally willing to insure anything.</p>
<p>保险公司一般说来愿意承保一切东西。</p>
<p>Insuring public or private property is a standard practice in most countries in the world.</p>
<p>承办公共财产或私人财产保险是世界上大部分国家的正常业务。</p>
<p>If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather.</p>
<p>如果你要举办一次露天游园会或盛宴，为避免碰上不好的天气而遭受损失也同样可以保险，</p>
<p>Needless to say, the bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will have to pay.</p>
<p>不用说，保险公司承担风险越大，你付的保险费也就越高。</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to hear that a shipping company has made a claim for the cost of salvaging a sunken ship.</p>
<p>航运公司为打捞沉船而提出索赔，这是常有的事，</p>
<p>But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique.</p>
<p>但某地当局为打捞一只焙制馅饼的盘子提出索赔，倒是件新鲜的事儿。</p>
<p>Admittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was 18 feet long and 6 feet wide.</p>
<p>这个馅饼盘子确实少见，有18英尺长，6英尺宽。</p>
<p>It had been purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair.</p>
<p>某地方当局买下它用来焙制一个巨大的馅饼为一年一度交易会助兴。</p>
<p>The pie committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal so they insured it for the trip.</p>
<p>馅饼委员会确认运输这只盘子的最佳方案是通过运河水运。于是，他们对这只盘子的运输安全投了保。</p>
<p>Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate.</p>
<p>盘子下水后不久，馅饼委员会成员们来到当地一家小酒店庆贺。</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own.</p>
<p>就在这个时候，许多十几岁的孩子爬盘子举行他们自己的集会。</p>
<p>Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during the party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water.</p>
<p>他们跳起了舞，盘子难以承受。舞会进行过程中，盘子倾覆，沉入了7英尺深的水中。</p>
<p>The pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish.</p>
<p>馅饼委员会给当地汽车修理库老板打电话，他闻讯后开着一辆急修车前来打捞盘子。</p>
<p>Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to locate the dish.</p>
<p>那些孩子们穿着湿衣服哆嗦，看着3个工人轮潜入水中以确定盘子的位置。</p>
<p>They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem.</p>
<p>他们没费多大事儿就找到了盘子。可是把盘子捞出却是一个很大的难题。</p>
<p>The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it.</p>
<p>盘子四边十分光滑，要在盘边拴上绳索或链条而同时又不损坏它是很难办到的。</p>
<p>Eventually chains were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation.</p>
<p>不过，他们终于将链条固定在盘子的一端，一台大功率的绞车开动起来。</p>
<p>The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank.</p>
<p>盘子慢慢浮出水面，被轻轻地拽向运河岸边。</p>
<p>For one agonizing moment, the dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the water.</p>
<p>在令人忐忑不安的瞬间，盘子晃晃悠悠地上了岸，但它突然失去了平衡，又跌回水中。</p>
<p>The men were now obliged to try once more.</p>
<p>工人们只得再来一次。</p>
<p>This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains.</p>
<p>这次，他们用沉重的金属夹子把盘子夹住，以便往盘子上安装铁链。</p>
<p>The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal.</p>
<p>这次，盘子必须垂直吊出水面，因为盘子的一边紧靠着运河河岸。</p>
<p>The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck.</p>
<p>绞盘机再次启动，一位工人发动了急修车的引擎。</p>
<p>Several minutes later, the dish was successfully hauled above the surface of the water.</p>
<p>几分钟后，盘子被成功地拽出了水面。</p>
<p>Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal.</p>
<p>波浪从盘子两侧急涌而出，在运河里掀起一股大浪。</p>
<p>There was a danger that the wave would rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again.</p>
<p>但是当波浪从河对岸折回来时，就有再次把盘子拖进水里的危险。</p>
<p>By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave returned.</p>
<p>工人们动作迅速，终于赶在那股大浪返回之前把盘子拽到了岸上。</p>
