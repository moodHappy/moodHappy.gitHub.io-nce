<p>Lesson17 The longest suspension bridge in the world</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known, sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme.</p>
<p>1524年，一位鲜为人知的意大利人维拉萨诺驾船驶进纽约港，并将该港名为安古拉姆。</p>
<p>He described it as 'a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river.'</p>
<p>他对该港作了这样的描述：&ldquo;地理位置十分适宜，位于两座小山的中间，一条大河从中间流过&rdquo;。</p>
<p>Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal,</p>
<p>虽然维拉萨诺绝对算不上一个伟大的探险家，但他的名字将流芳百世，</p>
<p>for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.</p>
<p>因为1964年11月21日建成的一座世界上最长的吊桥是以他的名字命名。</p>
<p>The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island.</p>
<p>维拉萨诺大桥由奥斯马.阿曼设计，连结着布鲁克林与斯塔顿岛，</p>
<p>It has a span of 4,260 feet.</p>
<p>桥长4,260英尺。</p>
<p>The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to be taken into account by its designer.</p>
<p>由于桥身太长，设计者不得不考虑了地表的形状。</p>
<p>Two great towers support four huge cables.</p>
<p>两座巨塔支撑着4根粗大的钢缆。</p>
<p>The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and concrete.</p>
<p>塔身建在巨大的水下钢盘混凝土平台上。</p>
<p>The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea.</p>
<p>平台深入海底100英尺。</p>
<p>These alone took 16 months to build.</p>
<p>仅这两座塔就花了16个月才建成。</p>
<p>Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet.</p>
<p>塔身高出水面将近700英尺。</p>
<p>They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended.</p>
<p>高塔支撑着钢缆，而钢缆又悬吊着大桥，</p>
<p>Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire.</p>
<p>4根钢缆中的每根由26，108股钢绳组成。</p>
<p>It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars, it would still only be carrying 1/3 of its total capacity.</p>
<p>据估计，若桥上摆满了汽车，也只不过是桥的总承载力的1/3。</p>
<p>However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge.</p>
<p>然而，这座桥重要特点不仅是它的规模与强度。</p>
<p>Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer's dream to creat 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.</p>
<p>尽管此桥很大，但它的结构简单，造型优美，实现了设计者企图创造一个&ldquo;尽量用细线条勾画出一个庞然大物&rdquo;的梦想。</p>
