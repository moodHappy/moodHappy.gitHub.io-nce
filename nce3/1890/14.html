<p>If the money was not paid promptly, the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop.</p>

<p>In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state, and after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them.</p>
<p>和平时期,当生意萧条时,霍克伍德便带领士兵进入某个城邦,纵火烧毁一两个农场,然后提出,如向他们缴纳保护金,他们便主动撤离。</p>

<p>霍克伍德用这种方法挣了大笔钱.</p>
<p>In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.</p>
