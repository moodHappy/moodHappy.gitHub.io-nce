<p>Book</p>
<p>课文</p>
<p>Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on where we have been brought up.</p>
<p>我们觉得一则笑话是否好笑，很大程度取决于我们是在哪儿长大的。</p>
<p>The sense of humour is mysteriously bound up with national characteristics.</p>
<p>幽默感与民族有着神秘莫测的联系。</p>
<p>A Frenchman, for instance, might find it hard to laugh at a Russian joke.</p>
<p>譬如，法国人听完一则俄国笑话可能很难发笑。</p>
<p>In the same way, a Russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke which would make an Englishman laugh to tears.</p>
<p>同样的道理，一则可以令英国人笑出泪来的笑话，俄国人听了可能觉得没有什么可笑之处。</p>
<p>Most funny stories are based on comic situations.</p>
<p>大部分令人发笑的故事都是根据喜剧情节编写的。</p>
<p>In spite of national differences, certain funny situations have a universal appeal.</p>
<p>尽管民族不同，有些滑稽的情节却能产生普遍的效果。</p>
<p>No matter where you live, you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say, Charlie Chaplin's early films.</p>
<p>比如说，不管你生活在哪里，你看查理.卓别林的早期电影很难不发笑。</p>
<p>However, a new type of humour, which stems largely from the U. S. , has recently come into fashion.</p>
<p>然而，近来一种新式幽默流行了起来，这种幽默主要来自美国。</p>
<p>It is called 'sick humour'.</p>
<p>它被叫作&ldquo;病态幽默&rdquo;。</p>
<p>Comedians base their jokes on tragic situations like violent death or serious accidents.</p>
<p>喜剧演员根据悲剧情节诸如暴死，重大事故等来编造笑话。</p>
<p>Many people find this sort of joke distasteful. The following example of 'sick humour' will enable you to judge for yourself.</p>
<p>许多人认为这种笑话是低级庸俗的。下面是个&ldquo;病态幽默&rdquo;的实例，你可据此自己作出判断。</p>
<p>A man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas.</p>

<p>The following day, however, the doctor consoled him by telling him that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good.</p>
<p>然而，第二天，医生安慰他说，出院欢度新年的可能性还是很大的，</p>
<p>The man took heart and sure enough, on New Year's Eve he was able to hobble along to a party.</p>
<p>那人听后振作了精神。果然，除夕时他可以一瘸一拐地去参加晚会了。</p>
<p>To compensate for his unpleasant experiences in hospital, the man drank a little more than was good for him.</p>
<p>为了补偿住院这一段不愉快的经历，那人喝得稍许多了一点。</p>
<p>In the process, he enjoyed himself thoroughly and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals.</p>
<p>在晚会上他尽情娱乐，一再告诉大家他是多么讨厌医院。</p>
<p>He was still mumbling something about hospitals at the end of the party when he slipped on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.</p>
