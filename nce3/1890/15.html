<p>He could not find his 50 pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could not get his arm out.</p>
<p>但他摸了半天也没找到那50便士硬币，他的胳膊反倒退不出来了。</p>
<p>A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter, but George was firmly stuck.</p>
<p>这时在他周围上了许多人，一位女士在乔治胳膊上抹了肥皂，黄油，但乔治的胳膊仍然卡得紧紧的。</p>
<p>The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters freed George using a special type of grease.</p>
<p>有人打电话叫来消防队，两位消防队员使用了一种特殊的润滑剂才使乔治得以解脱。</p>
