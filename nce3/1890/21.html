<p>课文</p>
<p>Boxing matches were very popular in England 200 years ago.</p>
<p>两百年前，拳击比赛在英国非常盛行。</p>
<p>In those days, boxers fought with bare fists for prize money.</p>
<p>当时，拳击手们不戴手套，为争夺奖金而搏斗。</p>
<p>Because of this, they were known as 'prizefighters'.</p>
<p>因此，他们被称作&ldquo;职业拳击手&rdquo;。</p>
<p>However, boxing was very crude, for there were no rules and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.</p>
<p>不过，拳击是十分野蛮的，因为当时没有任何比赛规则，职业拳击手有可能在比赛中受重伤，甚至丧命。</p>
<p>One of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764.</p>
<p>拳击史上最引人注目的人物之一是丹尼尔.门多萨，他生于1764年。</p>
<p>The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860, when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules.</p>
<p>1860年昆斯伯里侯爵第一次为拳击比赛制定了规则，拳击比赛这才用上了手套。</p>
<p>Though he was technically a prizefighter, Mendoza did much to change crude prizefighting into a sport, for he brought science to the game.</p>
<p>虽然门多萨严格来讲不过是个职业拳击手，但在把这种粗野的拳击变成一种体育运动方面，他作出了重大贡献。是他把科学引进了这项运动。</p>
<p>In his day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity. He was adored by rich and poor alike.</p>
<p>门多萨在的全盛时期深受大家欢迎，无论是富人还是穷人都对他祟拜备至。</p>
<p>Mendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing match when he was only 14 years old.</p>
<p>门多萨在14岁时参加一场拳击赛后一举成名。</p>
<p>This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most eminent boxer in England.</p>
<p>这引起当时英国拳坛名将理查德.汉弗莱斯的注意。</p>
<p>He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil was quick to learn.</p>
<p>他主动提出教授门多萨，而年少的门多萨一学就会。</p>
<p>In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him.</p>
<p>事实上，门多萨不久便名声大振，致使汉弗莱斯与他反目为敌。</p>
<p>The two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only be settled by a fight.</p>
<p>两个人争吵不休，显而易见，只有较量一番才能解决问题。</p>
<p>A match was held at Stilton, where both men fought for an hour.</p>
<p>于是两人在斯蒂尔顿设下赛场，厮打了一个小时。</p>
<p>The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was defeated.</p>
<p>公众把大笔赌注下到了门多萨身上，但他却输了。</p>
<p>Mendoza met Humphries in the ring on a later occasion and he lost for a second time.</p>
<p>后来，门多萨与汉弗莱斯再次在拳击场上较量，门多萨又输了一场。</p>
<p>It was not until his third match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England.</p>
<p>直到1790年他们第3次对垒，门多萨才终于击败汉弗莱斯，成了全英拳击冠军。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he founded a highly successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils.</p>
<p>同时，他建立了一所拳击学校，办得很成功，连拜伦勋爵也成了他的学生。</p>
<p>He earned enormous sums of money and was paid as much as ￡100 for a single appearance.</p>
<p>门多萨挣来大笔大笔的钱，一次出场费就多可达100英镑。</p>
<p>Despite this, he was so extravagant that he was always in debt.</p>
<p>尽管收入不少，但他挥霍无度，经常债台高筑。</p>
<p>After he was defeated by a boxer called Gentleman Jackson, he was quickly forgotten.</p>
<p>他在被一个叫杰克逊绅士的拳击手击败后很快被遗忘。</p>
<p>He was sent to prison for failing to pay his debts and died in poverty in 1836.</p>
<p>他因无力还债而被捕入狱，最后于1836年在贫困中死去。</p>
