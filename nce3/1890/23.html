<p>课文</p>
<p>People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten.</p>
<p>在决定什么能吃而什么不能吃的时候，人们往往变得不合情理。</p>
<p>If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus a great delicacy.</p>
<p>比如，如果你住在地中海地区，你会把章鱼视作是美味佳肴，</p>
<p>You would not be able to understand why some people find it repulsive.</p>

<p>As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own.</p>
<p>他住在大城市里的一所公寓里，没有自己的花园。</p>
<p>For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him.</p>
<p>多年来，他一直让我把我园子里的蜗牛收集起来给他捎去。</p>
<p>The idea never appealed to me very much, but one day, after a heavy shower, I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails taking a stroll on some of my prize plants.</p>
<p>一开始，他的这一想法没有引起我多大兴趣。后来有一天，一场大雨后，我在花园里漫无目的散步，突然注意到许许多多蜗牛在我的一些心爱的花木上慢悠悠的蠕动着。</p>
<p>Acting on a sudden impulse, I collected several dozen, put them in a paper bag, and took them to Robert.</p>
<p>我一时冲动，逮了几十只，装进一只纸袋里，带着去找罗伯特。</p>
<p>Robert was delighted to see me and equally pleased with my little gift.</p>
<p>罗伯特见到我很高兴，对我的薄礼也感到满意。</p>
<p>I left the bag in the hall and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>我把纸袋放在门厅里，与罗伯特一起进了起居室，在那里聊了好几个钟头。</p>
<p>I had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must stay to dinner.</p>
<p>我把蜗牛的事已忘得一干二净，罗伯特突然提出一定要我留下来吃晚饭，这才提醒了我。</p>
<p>Snails would, of course, be the main dish.</p>
<p>蜗牛当然是道主菜。</p>
<p>I did not fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room.</p>
<p>我并不喜欢这个主意，所以我勉强跟着罗伯特走进了起居室。</p>
<p>To our dismay, we saw that there were snails everywhere:</p>
<p>使我们惊愕的是门厅里到处爬满了蜗牛：</p>
<p>they had escaped from the paper bag and had taken complete possession of the hall!</p>
<p>它们从纸袋里逃了出来，爬得满厅都是！</p>
